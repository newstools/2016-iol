Cape Town - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has decided not to oppose the court interdict by President Jacob Zuma and his Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen on the release of the report on state capture.Mkhwebane said in papers in the Pretoria High Court on Friday she was leaving the decision in the hands of the court on whether to release the report or not.She said the determination will be made by the court on all matters surrounding the release of the report.Mkhwebane assumed her duties on October 15, and was in Parliament a few days later to brief MPs on the annual report of her office.But opposition parties were left surprised and unimpressed by her decision not to oppose the application by Zuma.Zuma and Van Rooyen had lodged urgent court interdicts against former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on the release of the report.Zuma lodged his application a day before Madonsela was due to release the report, and this was her last day in office.But after consultations with the lawyers it was decided that the report not be made public, and the matter will be heard in court on November 1.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it appeared Mkhwebane was succumbing to Zuma. He said she proving them right that she will succumb to the Executive.The DA, EFF, UDM and Cope have applied to the High Court as intervening parties in the application. They want the court to release the report as quickly as possible.Zuma and Van Rooyen complained that they were not given sufficient time to respond to the report. The President had wanted to question the witnesses who had given evidence against him to Madonsela. He had also demanded access to some of the evidence.But Madonsela had stuck to her guns that she had to respond to the questions she sent to him on March 22 on state capture.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
