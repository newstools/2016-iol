The bond between South Africans and Mozambicans could never be broken, said Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa. He described former Mozambique president Samora Machel as a revolutionary leader and guerilla fighter of his people. Mthatha is the programme director at the commemoration of the 30th anniversary to mark Machel's tragic death. Machel died after the plane he was travelling know crashed at Mbuzini in Mpumalanga. He was on his way to Maputo from Zambia where he had attended a summit of the Frontline States. About 43 other dignitaries died with him. Mthethwa said the two countries struggled together for independence. “We have to fight for economic integration so that the lives of our people are better,” said Mthethwa. Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza described Machel as “one of the greatest revolutionaries of our time. He led the struggle for the independence of Mozambique”. Family representative, Samora Machel Jr, said it still felt as if the plane crash occurred yesterday.  He credited Machel for working together the liberation  of other African counties including Zimbabwe, among others. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the keynote address at the event held at the Samora Machel Monument and Museum in Mbuzini. @luyolomkentane  luyolo.mkentane@inl.co.za  Political Bureau
