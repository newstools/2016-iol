Cape Town - Springbok star Siya Kolisi’s wife Rachel has broken her silence after racist trolls attacked her on social media over their interracial marriage. Rachel, who married the Stormers loose forward in August, and is helping him raise his brother and sister, says she and their have been called names. But she is not bothered by her haters, and says she actually feels sorry for people who have a problem with her marriage to one of SA’s hottest rugby stars and their son, Nicholas. On Friday morning, Rachel tweeted several Facebook messages she had found in her inbox, from a man named Charles Hermon, who had a profile picture of a black man. She tweeted: “Just checking my FB messages this AM, shame.” Charles Hermon allegedly messaged her: “Why do white h**s think they can f*** n**gers! F*** your own kind. Leave Africa and go back to Europe and leave our good men to our own beautiful black women. [sic]” He added: “I am sick of seeing this half breed popping out,” before making sexual references, ending, “Don’t need you here stealing our men.” Rachel says last year October, a man named Johan Pretorius from Strand allegedly messaged her on Twitter: “Looks like every kwota player these days has his dum blonde. First you take our sport and now you take our daughters what is next. [sic]” She responded to him, saying “...the sport does not belong to you and therefore cannot be taken away. I am a daughter first and foremost of God, certainly not you. Lastly under all this dum blonde’, I’m actually a brunette. I’ll be praying for you.” Rachel said she shared the messages so people would realise she doesn’t care about opinions on her marriage. She says she also gets messages from people seeking advice on dealing with interracial relationships issues. She tweeted on Sunday: “If it’s such an issue for you why you looking, [thinking face].” Siya has not commented on the issue. Daily Voice
