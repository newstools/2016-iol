Durban - People are invited to welcome the MSC Sinfonia to Durban for the start of the new 2016/17 cruise season. The Sinfonia arrives on a journey from Italy just after 6am on Tuesday with 2 600 European and South African passengers on board, and the cruise liner will be given a traditional tug water spraying welcome as she approaches the harbour entrance. To give the public the chance of seeing her sail in, Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) has arranged temporary public access to the Port’s North Pier viewing deck. To get there, go to the end of Mahatma Gandhi (Point) Road, where detours are in place because of construction in the area. The ship, which was extended by 24m last year, will berth at the Point and Leisure Precinct’s longer M-berth. Durban and provincial officials will celebrate the arrival of the ship at a welcoming ceremony at N-Shed, which was upgraded last year by TNPA and MSC Cruises. Several other international cruise liners will call into Durban during the forthcoming season. Daily News
