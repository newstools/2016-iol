Rustenburg &#x2013; Black South African farmers will march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the slow pace of land reform, the farmers said on Monday.African Farmers Association of South Africa (Afasa) secretary general, Aggrey Mahanjana said land reform was a ticking time bomb.He said coupled with inadequate post settlement farmer support, the slow pace of the land reform process could lead to a potential food crisis in the country.The march would be led by Afasa and the National Emergent Red Meat Producers Organisation (Nerpo) on Tuesday, from Irene where the two organisation held a joint annual congress from Monday.The farmers would use tractors and horse to march from Irene to the Union building.&#x201C;On this historic event, first of its kind, about 500 farmers will lead a procession forming a convoy of farm vehicles [tractors, trucks, horses, quad bikes etc.] from the St Georges Hotel and Conference Centre to the Union Buildings to submit their petition, list of demands and land reform and farmer support proposals to the State President [Jacob Zuma].&#x201D;He said the farmers have in the past discussed pertinent issues affecting the smallholder farmers in the country, and submitted proposals on how to expedite land reform and effective farmer support strategies to the department of rural development and land reform as well as the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries.But the farmers were not satisfied with the efforts made by both departments in addressing problems pertaining to land reform and farmer support.The march would highlight issues such as short term government farm leases, lack of title deeds, high land prices, farm caretakership contracts, farm availability as well as slow processes of support programmes such recapitalization and development programme, comprehensive agricultural support programme, Ilima/Letsema programme and disaster relief programmes.
