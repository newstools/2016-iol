“Instead of 7pm, they should have just said 9pm at least,” one of Anatii’s fans said while in the queue to get drinks while waiting for the show to start. The statement was justified as the concert only really began at 10pm, with local DJs playing music for the intimate crowd before that. Contrary to the “norm“ that usually sees international artists take to the stage last, Anatii flipped the script and had US singer Omarion open for him. Flamboyant choreographer Somizi Mhlongo introduced the artist, who started his set by singing a mini accapella version of his track “I’m sayin’’. From that moment on, the fans were screaming non-stop, mesmerised by Omarion’s voice and sexy dance moves. The ‘Speedin’ singer had a sing-along moment with the audience when he attempted to sing his hit track ‘Ice Box’ but he stopped mid-song, saying “Y’all gon’ be mad at me cause I don’t even like this song.” He also performed his other popular tunes like the 005 song 'I' and more the more recent 'Post to be'. He sealed off his set by perfoming one of his yet-to-be-released songs, ‘Distance’ which has an African feel to it and has the potential to be a banger! When Anatii took to the stage, lights went off, smoke filled the room and nothing but the rapper’s silhoette was visible at the centre of the stage, with fans taking in the moment. He performed ‘Pray for the Children’ first, from his Artiifact album, after which he took a moment to thank his fans for coming out. He took charge of the stage, occasionally joined by four female dancers and surprisingly showed off some impressive dance moves when he performed songs like ‘Special Somebody’. Chad da Don, JR and Dreamteam joined him for their blazing collaborations. Omarion came back on stage to do ‘Tell me what you want from me’ with Anatii before the last collabo ‘The Saga’ was perfomed with AKA, which fans went crazy over.   IOL
