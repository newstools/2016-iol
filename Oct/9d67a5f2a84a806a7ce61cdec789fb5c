AKA made sure his thoughts on the on going debate were made loud and clear in the tweets below: As a South African with global aspirations, making trap music doesn't make sense to me. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  The only trap music I'm interested in making is local trap music ..... Because locally, that's what people seem to like. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  READ: Thando Thabethe takes LA KANYE WEST is referencing SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSE MUSIC when he asks producers to cook for him ... So why are we looking abroad for inspiration? — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  There's a thin line in this country between trap/crap. 🇿🇦⚡️💩 — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  You know what's super embarrassing?? Old heads ditching their style, desperate for relevance, trying to make trap music. THAT shit is sad. 😢 — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  Before I go ... Here's a question for all artists out there. WHAT IS YOUR IDENTITY? SOUND WISE? GENRE WISE? DO YOU HAVE AN IDENTITY? — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016  If you take offense to the previous tweets. It just means you are making the shoe fit. If you my homie, you're my homie, Twitter ain't shit. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 6, 2016
