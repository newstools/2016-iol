By: Jason Woosey The fifth-generation CR-V that you see here might not have made any dramatic design departures but the SUV has been completely redesigned and reengineered, according to Honda. Turbo punch Like the latest Civic that was launched in South Africa recently, it also offers the option of a turbocharged petrol engine for the first time. This comes in the form of Honda's new 1.5-litre direct injection unit rated at 142kW, while lower-positioned models offer a 2.4-litre normally aspirated V-Tec. Both are mated to a CVT gearbox, with drive to the front or all wheels depending on the model. It's worth noting, however, that this is the US-spec CR-V and South African versions could differ. The 2017 CR-V rides on a new chassis, complete with a multi-link axle at the back, and Honda has raised the ground clearance slightly. Smarter cabin The new design not only liberates more interior space, with allegedly class-leading legroom, but Honda reckons it's a lot classier-looking too, thanks to upgraded materials and a new 'soft-touch' instrument panel. As you guessed, there is a long list of available features and gizmos, including an 18cm touch-screen infotainment system which has an Android operating system, although it is compatible with Apple CarPlay. Also offered is Adaptive Cruise Control with low-speed follow, Rear Cross Traffic Monitor, Auto High Beam headlights and a Hands-Free Access Power Tailgate.
