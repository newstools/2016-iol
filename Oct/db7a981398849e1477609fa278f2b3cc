Johannesburg - The SA Revenue Service has asked the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to dismiss a case by its former spokesman, Adrian Lackay, saying his has “ulterior motives”. Lackay approached the CCMA to declare that SARS constructively dismissed him in February 2015. The hearing got off to a late start on Monday. Lackay, who worked at the agency for 11 years, alleges, after the appointment of SARS commissioner Tom Moyane, he was unable to fulfil his responsibilities as spokesperson.

The hearing is set to continue over the next four days. LABOUR BUREAU
