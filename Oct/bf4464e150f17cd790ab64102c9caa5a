GUPTA-OWNED Oakbay Investments says its financial director, Ronica Ragavan, will assume the role of acting executive following Nazeem Howa’s immediate resignation yesterday. Citing health reasons, Howa decided to step down. The company was dealt a blow earlier this year when several banks closed accounts linked to the company, following allegations the Guptas exerted undue influence on the government. In a statement, Oakbay said Ragavan would be acting in the  position while it looked for a permanent successor.

I look forward to that day.” Howa joined the company  five years ago with an interest in  mining, technology and media  businesses. He also stepped down as  a non-executive director of JSE-listed Oakbay Resources and Energy Ltd. Ragavan said: “Nazeem has been an outstanding chief executive for Oakbay and embodied the company’s philosophy of hard work, innovative thinking, job creation and disruption where disruption creates value.” Oakbay Investments earlier this year announced its shareholdings would be sold by year-end. The company denied its decision to sell off its shareholdings in South Africa was linked to an investigation instituted by the National Treasury. The Guptas have been under fire following allegations they were involved in the firing and appointment of cabinet ministers.
