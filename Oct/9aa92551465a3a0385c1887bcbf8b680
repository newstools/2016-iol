Cape Town - An intelligence-driven sting operation by the Western Cape Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation&apos;s (Hawks) Narcotics Bureau led to the arrest of five people for possession of heroin valued at about R4.3 million, the Hawks said on Saturday. The arrests occurred when a Mitchells Plain-bound Toyota Fortuner towing a supposedly broken down Corsa bakkie on a trailer was spotted and pulled over near Grabouw on Friday, spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said.&#x201C;The resultant search of the vehicles led to the seizure of over 100,000 tablets and 1kg of heroin concealed in apparent false compartments of the Corsa.&#x201C;The outwitted suspects, aged between 19 and 52, are expected to appear in the Grabouw Magistrate&apos;s Court on Monday to face charges related to drug trafficking,&#x201D; Ramovha said.
