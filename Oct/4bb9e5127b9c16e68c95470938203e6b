Fresh off of a huge hosting gig as Trevor Noah’s MAMAs replacement, Bonang Matheba has announced that she’s back to host the South African of the Year Awards, which will be held at the Ticketpro Dome on November 25.  Popular TV personalities Jonathan Boynton-Lee and Jeannie D will join Matheba on hosting duty. According to organisers ANN7 US RnB-soul singer Robin Thicke will heat up the stage, “performing on South African soil for the first time alongside top local South African artists."   "The well-known international star Robin Thicke taught himself how to play the piano at the age of 16, and by 21 he was writing and producing for musicians who broke barriers in entertainment including Michael Jackson, Marc Anthony and Usher. Since then Robin’s worldwide acclaim has come from top charting singles ‘Lost Without You’,’ Magic’ and ‘Blurred Lines’, earning the multi- platinum artist a twelve week reign on the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100." They promise to make this year’s event “bigger & better”. The awards celebrate South Africa’s greatest musicians, artists, conservationists, sport, youth and business leaders.  IOL
