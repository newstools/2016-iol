Commenting on the 2016 competition, Elouise Matthys, PR and Promotions Manager at GrandWest, said: “As anticipated, the final stage of the 2016 Open Mic Jazz singing competition was a spectacular showcase of remarkable talent. The six finalists put on a super show which provided a fitting end to the weeks of grueling competition which started in August. “We were privileged to see some tremendous jazz performers on our stage during this year’s competition and our judging panel had a tough task deciding on our top three. “We extend heartfelt congratulations to our top three and thank all of our competitors for making the competition such a great success,” she added. - Staff Writer l Like on Facebook: GrandWestCasinoAndEntertainmentWorld, or follow the show on Twitter @GrandWestSA
