Durban &#x2013; The eThekwini Metro Municipality has promised to beef up security at the Durban City Hall after former members of the Azanian People&#x2019;s Liberation Army (Apla) disrupted a meeting of the municipality&#x2019;s executive committee (Exco) on Tuesday.A according to a statement from the municipality a group of people had to forcibly be ejected from the Exco meeting at the city hall.While the statement did not reveal who the group were, the Democratic Alliance&#x2019;s Zwakele Mncwango said that a number of Apla members, some of whom he thought were visibly under the influence of alcohol managed to get past security and into the meeting to make demands.According to Mdu Nkosi of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) more than 10 Apla members managed to storm the meeting. Both Mncwango and Nkosi said that the gripe was that these men had been excluded from benefits that were being accorded to members of the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) members.&#x201C;They were complaining about the preference given to MK veterans by the municipality. The issue is that the council favours MK veterans, but there are also others who fought against apartheid,&#x201D; said Mncwango.Nkosi said that he had been informed that the group had repeatedly attempted to arrange a meeting with a manager in the mayor&#x2019;s office.&#x201C;They have been trying to talk to a manager in the mayor&#x2019;s office, but he (the manager) refused to honour the meetings. They feel excluded,&#x201D; he said.According to the statement, Mayor Zandile Gumede said that the city was willing to engage with all parties.&#x201C;However, there are processes that have to be followed and the correct platforms used to communicate,&#x201D; she said.Gumede said the stakeholders were not given a platform to speak as it would set a bad precedent.&#x201C;If you allow one group of people to speak you will have to allow anyone who disrupts a meeting to do so, and we cannot allow that,&#x201D; she said.However, Nkosi said that the disruption was the third in recent memory, with municipal security personnel as well as MK veterans having previously disrupted Exco meeting.&#x201C;These things will continue because the precedent has already been set,&#x201D; he said.According to the statement upgrades will include an upgrade of access control and closed-circuit television cameras, recruitment of staff and minor structural configurations to create ease of traffic flow.By all accounts, the Apla members did not get to formally present their grievances and were ejected by security.Apla is the former armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress while uMkhonto we Sizwe is the former armed wing of the country&#x2019;s ruling African National Congress party.
