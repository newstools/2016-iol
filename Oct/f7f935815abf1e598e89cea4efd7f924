Pretoria &#x2013; Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Monday confirmed that he had invited National Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Shaun Abrahams, for a meeting at the African National Congress&#x2019; Luthuli House headquarters in central Johannesburg.&#x201C;Did I invite Shaun Abrahams, the National Director of Prosecutions to join me at Luthuli House? The answer is yes, I did. It is because I had received an invitation to go there to discuss the rapidly degenerating situation at university campuses relating to #FeesMustFall campaign. I immediately surmised that my only contribution there was likely to be what is happening at the level of the criminal justice system and criminal matters,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;I thought that given the short notice that I was given [before the meeting] and the fact that I would not be in a position to, off the cuff, provide up to date information &#x2026; I thought that based on the urgency of the matter and the need for government to decide on the course of action, I invited him.&#x201D;Journalists asked Masutha to explain whether he had fully considered that the venue, the national office of the governing party, would not be appropriate for a meeting with the NDPP who is supposed to be politically independent and impartial. The minister replied that the country&#x2019;s lead prosecutor had the liberty to enter any venue.&#x201C;The National Director of Public Prosecutions has the liberty to enter any venue and to attend the meeting. The last thing I had in mind was that the mere fact that the meeting was taking place at the headquarters of the ANC would be an issue. My primary focus was the urgency and the information that could be required from us to inform the appropriate action to address the situation.&#x201D;Masutha said the charging of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had already been communicated to him, before Abrahams attended the Luthuli House meeting.&#x201C;That matter had already been communicated to me well ahead of that day and I had already communicated to the president this issue. It was absolutely unnecessary for us at that meeting to repeat ourselves in regard to that matter,&#x201D; said Masutha.The minister said of the people in that controversial meeting, only him, President Jacob Zuma and Abrahams had knowledge of the Gordhan charges.&#x201C;The meeting was not for that purpose. It would not have been necessary at all for us at all to call a meeting on a matter to discuss the matter that we had been aware of,&#x201D; said Masutha.Last weekend, Sunday newspapers reported that Abrahams met Zuma and three Cabinet ministers behind closed doors at Luthuli House, just a day before the NDPP announced his contentious decision to charge Gordhan with fraud.The meeting, also attended by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and State Security Minister David Mahlobo, reportedly took place on October 10, hours before Zuma flew to Kenya on a State visit.On October 11, the rand took a knock as the National Prosecuting Authority announced that it had issued a formal summons against Gordhan amid the ongoing, politically-charged investigation into an intelligence unit within the South African Revenue Service.Gordhan and two other former top Sars officials are due to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on November 2.
