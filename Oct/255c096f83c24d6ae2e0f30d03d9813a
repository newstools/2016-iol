By Lindi Masinga Johannesburg - Witwatersrand University (Wits) management on Tuesday urged staff members and students, who were not protesting to remain indoors and to lock their buildings for their own safety until further notice. “For your own safety, we advise all staff and students who are not part of the protests to remain indoors, to stay away from the protests, and to lock buildings and offices until further notice,” Wits senior executives said in a statement. On Monday, protesting students declared that the Wits University institution would not be open until their demand for free education was met, despite agreeing with management to resume academic activities. Wits confirmed that there had been no disruptions reported on its Parktown campuses. The protests, which could result in the university possibly shutting down the 2016 academic year, started more than two weeks ago after Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande announced that state universities could hike next year’s fees, but that it would be capped at eight percent. “We have reports of two students being arrested, and one student and one staff member being injured. We have had reports of rocks and bottles thrown at [the] buildings and [at] the police. The police are managing the situation. They have tried to disperse the students using tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades,” they university said. Wits management has said it they would update students throughout the day on a way forward regarding academic activities. “If in doubt, please speak to your respective head of school, dean, or executive member. We have been trying to reach student leaders but they do not want to engage.” African News Agency
