After filling the Coca Cola Dome in October 2015, Nyovest announced to fans that he hoped to double this feat at Orlando Stadium in the hope to bring together all races in of the rainbow nation. Sure to add their unique and exciting flair to the concert, the four entertainers will each take a turn to introduce supporting artists including top House DJs and Euphonik and DJ Fresh, as well as rap high rollers Riky Rick, Major League, Kwesta, Nasty C, Babes Wodumo, and many others. Local celebrities, including AKA, Bonang came out to wish him luck:  Good Morning! This is the day the lord has made. @casspernyovest, today is your day. Good luck & God bless.  â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) October 29, 2016  IOL
