Johannesburg - An SANDF member has taken Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to the high court after his department allegedly refused to register his eight-month-old daughter, born to a Congolese woman, as a South African national.Menzile Lawrence Naki filed papers in the high court in Grahamstown on Tuesday in which he gave a detailed account of his troubles in registering his daughter, who was born in February. In court papers, Naki stated that his child was born at Settler&#x2019;s Hospital in Grahamstown and her mother is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo.He said he met Dimitrila Marie Ndovya while he was deployed as a peacekeeper in Goma in 2008.&#x201C;We fell in love soon after we met and I later proposed to her. In 2008, we entered into a customary marriage in the DRC.&#x201C;My mission ended in 2009 and I returned to South Africa. Dimitrila and I remained in constant communication. I returned to the DRC in 2013, on another peacekeeping mission,&#x201D; he said.He said in September last year, Ndovya came to South Africa &#x201C;leaving our elder child in the DRC in the care of her mother. She travelled on her Congolese passport, having been issued with a three-month visitor&#x2019;s visa in Lubumbashi. The visa expired on December 23, 2015.&#x201C;At the time the visa expired, she was heavily pregnant, a factor that made it practically impossible for her to apply timeously for a new visa. Dimitrila also could not leave South Africa due to her pregnancy. She wouldn&#x2019;t have received medical permission to travel.&#x201C;Dimitrila and I decided that given her medical condition, she would apply for a new visa immediately after giving birth, so as to regularise her stay in the country,&#x201D; Naki said.She gave birth to the child on February 1.&#x201C;At the Home Affairs office, we were advised that my daughter&#x2019;s birth could not be registered until Dimitrila had regularised her stay in South Africa and could produce a valid visa or permit.&#x201C;The Home Affairs officials consequently refused to accept our application and supporting documentation for the registration of Novuyo&#x2019;s birth.&#x201D;He said that was the reason he made the court application under the Promotion of Access to Justice Act to force the Home Affairs Department to register his daughter.&#x201C;Dimitrila has been unable to apply, at the Grahamstown office, for a spousal visa or for permission to remain in South Africa pending the outcome of that application.&#x201C;She is too afraid to travel to another Home Affairs office to lodge such applications, fearing that she will be arrested or detained as an illegal foreigner,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;She has found herself with no practical choice but to return to the DRC - with the child.&#x201C;We remain unable to register Novuyo&#x2019;s birth until Dimitrila is lawfully (back) in South Africa and can produce documentation to establish the lawfulness of her presence.&#x201C;Without registering Novuyo&#x2019;s birth, I cannot get her a passport and she will not be able to travel with, or to see, her mother and will be indefinitely separated from her.&#x201D;He said he also lodged his court application to help others facing a similar plight.
