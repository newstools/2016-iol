Thankfully there were no reported fatalities in this scary accident, in which an Infiniti FX driver, who was going way too fast for the slippery conditions, lost control and smashed into a stationary BMW X3. The latter was apparently pushed back 20 metres, and the car from which the video was recorded was also hit.
