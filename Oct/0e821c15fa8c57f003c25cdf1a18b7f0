Johannesburg - It may look harmless, but a pesky moth from South America with a predilection for tomatoes and potatoes threatens to wreak havoc on South Africa's food security. On Friday, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Daff) announced that the moth, known as the tomato-leaf miner, had been detected for the first time in the eastern reaches of Mpumalanga. “This pest is disastrous, particularly for tomato production and food security in general,” it said. It puts additional pressure on farmers and consumers as the drought worsens and produce production is already facing strains. After two years of surveillance by farmers, Tuta absoluta was detected for the first time from five surveillance traps set in late August, three of which were in the southern part of the Kruger Park, one on a tomato farm near Komatipoort and one at the Lebombo border post. “Specimens were sent to Daff’s plant health diagnostic labs and the identification was confirmed by a Lepidoptera specialist from the Agricultural Research Council.” Saturday Star
