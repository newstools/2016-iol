Johannesburg - As Cosatu gears up for its march for decent work on Friday, its unions have pledged their messages of support for the federation. Police union Popcru and the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers Union (Ceppwawu) on Thursday called on their members to join the national strike which will coincide with the World Day for Decent Work. “These ongoing struggles for decent work are compromised by the need to urgently attend to the many varying issues negatively affecting workers across many countries. With many working under labour brokers, unsafe conditions and earning minor salaries in the midst of continued rises in the cost of living,” said Popcru in a statement. On Wednesday Cosatu said it had done enough to mobilise its members, with general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali predicting that about 200,000 workers would take to the streets in all the provinces. The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has also pledged its support for Cosatu and promised to mobilise communities to join in their numbers. Ntshalintshali told journalists that the decent work strike was largely driven by the government not doing enough to transform the economy to benefit workers. The federation was also concerned about the increased casualisation of employment and labour brokers. Its demands will also include a call for e-tolls to scrapped, the implementation of the national minimum wage and the National Health Insurance plan, the scrapping of labour brokers and for an acceptable public transport system. While the federation has received support from its unions, its former affiliates Numsa and Fawu have said they would not support the action as they had their own plans for fighting for decent jobs.
