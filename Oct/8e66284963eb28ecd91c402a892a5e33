This is no longer #FeesMustFall as we knew it in 2015 &#x2013; it has become #StateMustFall, says David Everatt.The polarising effects of #FeesMustFall are now pervasive in the academy, and probably beyond. Academics turn on each other, as do their schools and faculties.Whole universities are pitted against one another &#x2013; the &#x201C;Wits option&#x201D; vs the &#x201C;UCT option&#x201D;. Some academics are accused of being blindly supportive of &#x201C;the innocent students&#x201D; and parading their colours as the immaculate left; while others are seen as blindly securocrat, unreconstructed racists, or terminally bewildered.So let&#x2019;s (try to) agree on a modicum of common ground. Remarkably, there is a lot of it about. No-one can reasonably argue that universities are not underfunded. No-one can reasonably argue that the impact of underfunding has been transferred to fee increases, and that in turn, black (primarily African and coloured) students bear the burden. Given the failure of the post-apartheid economy to sufficiently redistribute wealth and the abject failure of trickle-down economics, &#x201C;black debt&#x201D; is a reality.Let&#x2019;s also accept that for many students, much of the academy is an alienating, overwhelmingly white, Eurocentric space and experience. Students arrive and are expected to meet imported norms, seminar room sarcasm, unknown customs, foreign authors, hard marking and plain hard slog of tertiary education, while being young and going through their own life transitions, and doing so in &#x201C;othered&#x201D; spaces, out of vernacular, and so on.Let us also agree that virtually no university or further education college has genuinely grappled (institutionally, not at the level of the individual) with what it means to decolonise, beyond (at best) looking around quickly for some black/African authors. This is not true at school level, where many advances have been made &#x2013; but these are islands in an ocean. Students swim in the ocean.Let&#x2019;s also accept the dangers of commodified knowledge and universities, and the fact that the system is slowly becoming a sausage machine for lawyers, accountants, MBAs and others deemed economically necessary for the economy. Those schools and faculties seen to add no &#x201C;dollar value&#x201D; are discriminated against locally and globally.I say &#x201C;let&#x2019;s agree&#x201D; because these issues have all been agreed to by both protesters and university management. There may be quibbles over the severity of this or that issue in this or that part of the sector, but the central issues are undisputed.Divided we fallSo what divides us, and with such vehemence? For the immaculate left, it is ultimately a capitalist state that has no interest in the poor emerging from poverty; overlapping with black people in a society dominated by whiteliness; creating an unreconstructed racial capitalism that needs to be toppled. Students in this view lack agency, and are in every context victims of external forces. Every action is the response of victim to oppressor.&#x201C;Senior management&#x201D; is seen to lead with security, follow up with more security, and have no interest in negotiation or compromise. Students just want a free, decolonised education in a transformed institution and are shot for daring to ask for it &#x2013; and they remain innocent, brutalised &#x201C;black bodies&#x201D;.For those who are not in this group, there is a basic commitment to teach, and to getting students to complete the academic year. They are disregarded as &#x201C;liberals&#x201D;, the ultimate South African insult. Security is regarded as a necessary evil &#x2013; but since many academics have personally been assaulted and/or abused and/or disrupted, and many targeted for hiding students desperate to learn and/or shielding them from protesters, security seems a basic necessity. The pleas from students for support to finish the year have been incessant.Returning to classWhat is at fault with all these views is the assumption that if protesters win enough compromises &#x2013; such as sector-wide agreement on free, quality, decolonised education and the need to plan, design and cost it so that it can be an implementable reality not a slogan (being self-evidently not swiftly realised) &#x2013; they will return to class. And they will do so as victors. We know that the vast majority of non-protesters also want to be back in class - and a great many are there already. But this core assumption is wrong.It is increasingly difficult to retreat from the notion that this is an incipient insurrection. While some protesters are undoubtedly idealistic and brave fighters for free quality education, the movement of 2015 has been colonised by political parties and anarchist movements in 2016. A movement without prominent leaders of 2015 has become leaderless in 2016.Acts of bravery and camaraderie in 2015 have become acts of racist abuse and thuggish violence in 2016. Burning has replaced marching; destruction of university infrastructure is a key goal. This is no longer #FeesMustFall as we knew it &#x2013; it has become #StateMustFall.Universities are being used for testing the potential for broader insurrection &#x2013;- if you can bring down universities you can bring down cities, if you can bring down cities, you can collapse and take control of the state. No compromise will get the core protesters back into class, or satisfy their academic or political mentors, because their goal is so much larger: state capture. It has allegedly been done once under democracy, so why not again?Who is to blame?Politics hates a vacuum, more than nature. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) is morally compromised on every front. Seemingly all courts in the land are packed with lawyers attempting to stop good governance and allow uninterrupted bingeing at the trough. The brazen moves to cover various political derrieres are breathtaking &#x2013; but create space for any other party to claim the moral high ground.In 1976 during the Soweto youth uprising, protesting students were given political education by mainly the Black Consciousness Movement. Those students went into exile got their education from the liberation movement organisations, the ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC). Whether they were Africanist &#x2013; closer to the PAC &#x2013; or Charterist &#x2013; aligned with the ANC &#x2013; they were taught about the democratic state that had to be built and the principles on which it was to be built. Who now provides political education for protesting students?The ANC is utterly compromised and cannot claim the moral authority to &#x201C;lead&#x201D;. The Democratic Alliance and ANC student wings, DASO and Sasco respectively, were loud in proclaiming their various Student Representative Council victories earlier in the year but have vanished from the scene. The prominence of Economic Freedom Fighters leaders &#x2013; at national and student level &#x2013; may or may not be relevant. So too the various incarnations of Black First Land First, pan-Africanist student movements and others. We are reduced to using student leaders of the 1980s as mediators, still on the faulty assumption that protesters want to return to class. They don&#x2019;t. They are far more ambitious than that.We have to call the bluff of those who keep moving the goalposts. Universities have agreed to free, quality, decolonised education in a transformed institution. Exam dates have been changed. Exam content is being modified to accommodate lost classes. But then the demands shift &#x2013; we want this fully legislated now, or we won&#x2019;t return to class. Or, we want amnesty for students suspended after due process regardless of what they did. Or, we want students arrested by police released. And so on and so on. These are patently not demands that the academy has the legal mandate to meet, even if we assume it had the will so to do.If we do not call this for what it is, we face the danger of realising apartheid architect Hendrik Verwoerd&#x2019;s dream &#x2013; the man who advised us: &#x201C;There is no place for [the Bantu] in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour &#x2026; What is the use of teaching the Bantu child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice? That is quite absurd.&#x201D;If, as seems likely, for the second year in a row, university students in South Africa are going to complete only part of their annual curriculum, and will be examined on only part of their curriculum, the result is that every subsequent year is divided between &#x201C;catching up&#x201D; on what was missed and squeezing a year of teaching into less time &#x2013; we face the danger of ensuring that no student will receive even a quality colonised education (an oxymoron for some, of course). We are not educating our students to compete locally or globally. We are crippling them. They are being sacrificed for the few who see state capture as tantalisingly close.
