Durban - Call him bumptious, offensively arrogant or even racist and sexist, but there&#x2019;s one thing you have to concede about Donald Trump. Like the late Amichand Rajbansi, he never misses a trick to whip up publicity.Having already offended droves of women voters, African-Americans, Mexicans and Muslims, the beleaguered Republican Party candidate turned his attention to wooing the minority Hindu community in the US last week.He was guest of honour when about 5 000 members of the Republican Hindu Coalition rolled up for a glitzy rally in New Jersey, ostensibly to raise funds for victims of terrorism in India and Bangladesh. But with Trump&#x2019;s star billing and heavy doses of Indian nationalist rhetoric at the event, charity took a back seat.The Republican chump didn&#x2019;t get a chance to dance the bhangra, but made up for it with his songs of praise for India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, declaring that India and the US would be &#x201C;best friends&#x201D; if he makes it to the White House.And, true to form, he showed a predictable ignorance of Indian religious and cultural realities, telling his audience: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a big fan of Hindu, and I&#x2019;m a big fan of India. Big, big fan.&#x201D; Almost as if Hindu and India are synonymous. Nor did he realise the capital of India is not Mumbai, as he claimed, but New Delhi.After a rendition of the national anthem, the audience was treated to a bizarre video featuring a simulated terrorist attack in which two couples are rescued by men dressed as US Navy Seals - presumably tapping into the anti-Muslim sentiment inspired by Trump in the US.Guests then rose for the Star-Spangled Banner before dancing to Bruce Springsteen&#x2019;s Born in the USA. How patriotic.Now, before you start drawing any conclusions, let&#x2019;s get a few things clear. First, Indians in the US are among the highest-earning and most-educated in the country. And as glitzy as last week&#x2019;s Diwali bash might have been, it won&#x2019;t make much of a difference at the November 8 polls. Indian-Americans traditionally support the Democratic Party overwhelmingly. A recent survey showed that if the vote were held today, 67 percent would support Hillary Clinton with only 7 percent for Trump.So it&#x2019;s back to the drawing board for Donald as he gropes for votes in new constituencies.The Sunday Independent
