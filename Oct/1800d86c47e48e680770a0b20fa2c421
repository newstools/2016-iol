Johannesburg - Orlando Pirates fans have demanded that the killers of the club&#x2019;s captain Senzo Meyiwa be brought to book no later than August next year.To mark the second anniversary of Meyiwa&#x2019;s killing at his singer girlfriend Kelly Khumalo&#x2019;s home on October 26, 2014, the Orlando Pirates Gauteng supporters branch - accompanied by community members - handed in a memorandum to the police on Wednesday after marching in the streets of Vosloorus.&#x201C;We, as the Orlando Pirates Gauteng branch, football supporters as well as citizens of South Africa, we want to see justice being served as it is now two years since the case has been under investigation, with no progress.&#x201C;We want to see the killers of Senzo Meyiwa behind bars as soon as possible; no one is above the law. We demand this case (be resolved) now,&#x201D; said the memorandum handed over to Brigadier Themba Denge of the Vosloorus police.Pirates fan Philip Jwarha said Senzo&#x2019;s killers didn&#x2019;t rob only the club, but the rest of South Africa and his friends and family too. &#x201C;Since Senzo died, the spirit in both Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana is not the same. They are not doing badly, but the standard has dropped.&#x201D;It has been two years since the footballer was killed, and no one has been arrested.Joseph Bogosing, who was among the supporters, said he was concerned about service delivery at Vosloorus police station and the cops&#x2019; complacency regarding Meyiwa&#x2019;s killers.&#x201C;This is the second year and no one has been charged for Senzo&#x2019;s murder yet. I don&#x2019;t know what is taking the police so long because Senzo wasn&#x2019;t alone in that house.&#x201C;We (fans) cannot go and demand answers from those people, but the police have power and authority to do so. By August next year, the killers should be behind bars,&#x201D; he said.Gladys Mokhomo, who was part of the march, was optimistic about the police&#x2019;s efforts in finding the killers.&#x201C;What happened was tragic, and my heart is as sore as if it all happened on Wednesday, but I have faith in the police.They will arrest those who did this horrible thing,&#x201D; she said.Denge accepted the memorandum and thanked the supporters and community for their concern.
