Johannesburg - Business confidence in South Africa fell to its lowest in three decades in September, reflecting uncertainty about the outlook for Africa's most industrialised economy, a survey showed on Wednesday. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry's (SACCI) monthly business index dipped to 90.3 in September from 92.9 in August, its worst showing since July 1985. “The general overview of the demand side of the economy suggests a tight economic situation for all subjects of the economy, including consumers, investors and the public sector,” SACCI said. “The most pressing of the present situation is the lack of confidence by notably investors.” Reuters
