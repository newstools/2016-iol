Kimberley - The dire lack of available mental health facilities in Kimberley has once again been highlighted as the family of a patient, who has to be tied up and locked inside the house for safety reasons, is struggling to have her admitted at West End Hospital.Family members explained that the 56-year-old grandmother ate her own faeces if her hands were not tightly fastened behind her back with bandages.&#x201C;We are at our wits&#x2019; end, as she needs to be cared for at a professional institution. She does not recognise her own son or grandchildren, who help to take care of her.&#x201C;We are sometimes forced to secure the bandages to the window. She eats everything from plastic, wire, acid, household detergent, rat poison, her doctor&#x2019;s referral letter, the prescription pamphlet and her blankets.&#x201C;Her bed and the bedroom floor is washed and disinfected on a daily basis as it becomes heavily soiled, even though she wears adult nappies.&#x201C;She has a good appetite but is extremely thin and frail. She complains of pain when we bath her,&#x201D; the family said.They added that she became confused and disorientated if she was allowed to walk around freely in the streets.&#x201C;The police found her wandering in Soul City after she had fallen into a sewerage canal. When we go to work, we have to leave her locked inside the house and close the bedroom door to prevent her from leaving the house and losing her way. We only let her walk around the house when we are able to keep a watch over her.&#x201D;They indicated that she was left in the care of her grandchildren - aged seven and 11 years - when their mother worked night shifts and their father went to work.&#x201C;It is difficult for them, as they do not have any time to enjoy a normal childhood.&#x201C;We moved into the house as she was not able to take care of herself. She had a boyfriend but we advised him that it was not conducive for him to be living with her.&#x201D;The family added that doctors at Kimberley Hospital had attributed her behaviour to a shrunken cortex, which was the result of a history of heavy smoking.&#x201C;They said that she did not qualify to be admitted at West End Hospital, as she is not psychotic. However, she is not herself and her behaviour cannot be described as normal.&#x201C;She was such a lively person before she suddenly fell ill and her health rapidly deteriorated, about two years ago.&#x201D;Relatives stated that while they cared for the grandmother and would never abandon her, they would feel more at ease if she received specialised medical care on a 24-hour basis&#x201C;While she is not an aggressive person, she was also tied up and sedated when she was kept for observation at Kimberley Hospital. She was sent back home after spending one night at a care facility in Britstown earlier this year, as they said that she was displaying aggressive tendencies. They found her wandering around the busy street after she managed to escape.&#x201D;They added that she was in a better state if she did not take her medication.&#x201C;Although she never sleeps, the medication acts as a strong sedative and turns her into a zombie. The doctors said that there is no medical treatment or procedure that can improve her condition. We are praying to God to either heal her to good health or take her, so that she can be relieved of this debilitating illness.&#x201C;Perhaps she could have been accommodated if the new Kimberley mental hospital had been completed, as there are no other available facilities. We were told to wait until she is 60 years old so that she can be referred to Harmony Home. Perhaps there are no beds available at West End Hospital.&#x201D;Spokeswoman for the Department of Health, Lulu Mxekezo, pointed out that tying a patient up was a violation of their human rights.&#x201C;The department will conduct an investigation as well as assist the family with confirmation of the diagnosis and assess the type of care needed. Health care personnel always provide all the information for the family about diagnosis and the level of care required,&#x201D; said Mxekezo.She added that the department would establish whether the patient was left in the care of her grandchildren.&#x201C;The Northern Cape Department of Health will investigate the matter and involve the relevant departments to deal with the matter. If the allegations prove to be true, corrective measures will be implemented.&#x201D;Mxekezo pointed out that many families rejected their loved ones if they did not understand or were unable to deal with their behaviour.She stated that community-based mental health care was advocated in favour of prolonged stays at facilities, such as West End Hospital.&#x201C;There is a set criteria that must be met before a patient is admitted at West End Hospital. The person must be observed for a period of 72 hours at a general hospital to confirm a condition of mental illness.&#x201D;Mxekezo added that substance abuse and brain tumours could mimic the symptoms of mental illness or psychosis.&#x201C;A diagnosis can only be confirmed following a thorough medical examination and a patient&#x2019;s detailed history is examined. The family is advised to interact with the doctor who examined the patient so that they can fully understand the diagnosis and treatment thereof. A second opinion can also be sought if not satisfied with initial diagnosis.&#x201D;She said district hospitals were required in terms of the regulations to be equipped with a mental health ward and a district specialist mental health team consisting of a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, advanced psychiatric nurse and an occupational therapist.&#x201C;This policy will reduce the demands for beds at West End Hospital as patients will be managed near their homes.&#x201D;Diamond Fields Advertiser
