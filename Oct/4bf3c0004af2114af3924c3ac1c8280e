Newport - Donald Trump&apos;s campaign on Tuesday launched its first nightly news show on his Facebook page, featuring former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a guest in its debut live feed.&quot;People are enthusiastic,&quot; Giuliani said. The atmosphere of Tuesday&apos;s live news feed was relaxed and reminiscent of a talk show with the three hosts standing behind laptops placed on high tables and Giuliani standing to one side. Other individuals were heard in the background talking and carrying on business in the office.Giuliani was on air for just over 5 minutes discussing popular support for Republican candidate Trump in several US states. The show lasted more than 20 minutes as the cohosts discussed the ramifications of Obamacare, as well as Democratic rival Hillary Clinton&apos;s email scandal.Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and advisor Jason Miller were supposed to be interviewed by the new show&apos;s hosts - campaign advisor Boris Epshteyn, Trump personal advisor Cliff Sims and conservative commentator for TheBlaze Tomi Lahren, according to an earlier report by Wired.Live streaming of the new show will begin at 6.30pm EST (10.30pm GMT) every day, though Tuesday&apos;s edition was delayed due to Trump streaming live from a campaign rally in Tallahassee, Florida. The segments will be streamed from Trump Tower.On Monday, Epshteyn said the Facebook live shows are intended to circumvent corporate mainstream news outlets that Trump has publicly denounced as being heavily biased and in collusion with the Clinton campaign.&quot;This is us delivering our message to voters.. It&apos;s about using 21st century technology and communication in a way that&apos;s effective,&quot; Epshteyn was quoted as saying by Wired.The US presidential election is set for November 8.Sputnik IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
