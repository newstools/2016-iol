London - A former banker accused of murdering two prostitutes fantasised aboutkidnapping school girls and holding them as sex slaves, a Hong Kong court heard on Tuesday.Briton Rurik Jutting, 31, said he wanted to abduct three pupils fromWycombe Abbey girls&#x2019; school in Buckinghamshire.In a harrowing video diary recorded on his iPhone, he confessed: &#x2018;They would be, say, 15 years old and I would basically turn these three girls into my sex slaves, it would be good to psychologically play them off against each other.&#x2019;He revealed how he wanted to torture and rape a variety of young girls to &#x2018;build up experience&#x2019;.The sex fantasywas laid bare in 42 &#x2018;confessional&#x2019; videos made by the former Merrill Lynch banker, who denies murdering two Indonesian prostitutes at his high-rise apartment in Hong Kong.The privately-educated Cambridge graduate described in one video how he had killed one call girl &#x2018;five minutes ago&#x2019; after taking &#x2018;a lot of coke&#x2019;.Jutting filmed himself in the hours leading up to the death of Sumarti Ningsih on October 27 2014 and in the days following. His second victim, Seneng Mujiasih, 26, was killed five days later.In one film shown to Hong Kong&#x2019;s High Court on Tuesday, the former financier speaks five minutes after he killed Ningsih, who was held captive for three days before her throat was cut and her body chopped up and left in a suitcase.He remarked casually: &#x2018;Obviously it was a terrible waste of life.&#x2019;In another clip he admitted he felt &#x2018;horny&#x2019; and &#x2018;hungry&#x2019; hours after killing Ningsih, 23, and filmed the shower in his flat where her naked body was slumped in a pool of blood. &#x2018;When I am high on coke, I have a propensity to do stupid stuff,&#x2019; he told the camera.&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t know I would go as far as I did. I killed someone. Jesus.&#x2019;Later, he added: &#x2018;One of the triggers (for killing her) was when I made her shave her eyebrows. That made her less like an attractive hooker and more like a thing.&#x2019;Earlier the jury of five men and four women watched horrifying video of Jutting asking the woman if she loved him before torturing her.He is heard saying: &#x2018;Do you want me to hit you? If you say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, I hit you once. If you say &#x201C;No&#x201D; I hit you twice&#x201D;. If you scream I will punch you, you understand?&#x2019;The only sound that can be heard from Ningsih is a muted squeal.Jutting called police to his flat, where they found her remains in a suitcase and the body of sex worker Mujiasih, who had been stabbed. Discussing his descent into cocaine-fuelled sexual depravity, Jutting also admitted blowing $1million on vice girls and drugs in two years, having first paid for sex when he got a bonus of more than &#xA3;100,000 as a 23-year-old banker.He said: &#x2018;How the f*** does a single man with no dependants spend more than a million dollars in two years? The answer is drugs and prostitutes.&#x2019; The defendant made clear to his parents and brother that they should not blame themselves for his behaviour.In one excerpt, Jutting said: &#x2018;Mum and dad, don&#x2019;t blame yourself... There is nothing you could have done. Regular phone calls would not have changed who I am.&#x2019;Originally from Cobham, Surrey, Jutting, who has previously admitted manslaughter, worked in the Hong Kong office of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in structured equity finance and trading.He watched the video evidence from the dock on Tuesday, at times closing his eyes.In one of his last videosbefore his arrest, he admitted he was suffering from drug-inducted paranoia about police surrounding his flat.
