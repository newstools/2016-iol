Summer is officially heading our way, bringing with it longer days, shorter nights and higher temperatures. Since we often tend to leave our healthy habits at home when going on holidays and getaways, make sure you don’t forget to pack some Vita Cocos in your case to tame your thirst the healthy way. Vita Coco is an all-natural product, with lower sugar levels than your typical smoothies, juices and sports drinks (plus the sugar is naturally too!) and it doesn’t contain added sweeteners, colourings, or flavourings. READ: Win an ALCATEL Go Play smartphone valued at R3 499 Vita Coco contains one single ingredient: fresh coconut water. The coconut water used comes from young green coconuts and is bursting with naturally occurring electrolytes including high levels of potassium (potassium helps prevent cramping). It’s a great way to re-hydrate whether on the go, after a gym session or even as a pick me up after a heavy night out! Vita Coco is available in four tasty flavours - Vita Coco Natural Coconut Water, Vita Coco Lemonade, Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple, and Vita Coco Coconut Water with Peach & Mango. This refreshing nutritional drink comes in two re-sealable pack sizes: 330ml for on the go; and 1 litre for take home consumption. Vita Coco is available at WOOLWORTHS Stores nationwide, independent retailers, lifestyle and fitness centres. It retails from R24,95 for the 330ml and R54,95 for the 1 Litre.

With no colourants, preservatives or flavourings and never produced from concentrate, some say it’s just like sticking a straw in a coconut! Enter the competition below:
