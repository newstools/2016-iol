Cape Town - Western Cape police have refused to be drawn on whether there were links between recent arms cache discoveries and the arrest of a local businessman allegedly connected to a former Gauteng police officer.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they were investigating after 250 firearms were discovered in a bunker in a Valhalla Park house on Friday. Four people were arrested. This follows the discovery of an arms cache in a Kleinvlei cemetery in August.In July, police arrested Rondebosch businessman Irshaad Laher, who allegedly smuggled police-confiscated firearms to local gangs. Laher was arrested after former police colonel Chris Prinsloo entered into a plea bargain. Prinsloo allegedly sold at least 2 000 guns to Laher. In return for co-operating with the state, Prinsloo was jailed for 18 years.Weekend Argus questioned the national and provincial police on whether there were links between the arms-related busts.While Van Wyk replied, &#x201C;Everything is under investigation. We are not going to speculate&#x201D;, Brigadier Sally de Beer, spokeswoman for the national police, said they hoped Friday&#x2019;s arrest would &#x201C;assist us in clamping down on the scourge of gangsterism&#x201D;.Laher is scheduled to return to the Bellville Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Wednesday. He is out on R100 000 bail and faces charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and theft of firearms and ammunition.Laher&#x2019;s assets, worth R9-million, have also been frozen. This includes his Rondebosch home worth about R3m. Weekend Argus
