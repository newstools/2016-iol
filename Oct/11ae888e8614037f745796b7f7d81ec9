Durban - We&apos;re ready to make Durban the comedy capital of the country.That was the message at Thursday&#x2019;s launch of a partnership between On Fire comedy specialists, owned by Jem Atkins and Jess Knauf, with entertainment company Whacked, owned by comedian John Vlismas.At the launch at the New York Restaurant in Morningside, Vlismas, who is originally from Durban, said: &#x201C;Twenty years ago, I started in comedy in Durban and struggled for four or five years before moving to Joburg. I was here for last year&#x2019;s Summer Comedy Festival which was sold out.&#x201C;On Fire&#x2019;s comedy gigs at different venues around Durban are full, which used to be unheard of.&#x201C;We are not looking to make Durban like Joburg or Cape Town. In fact, Durban can beat Cape Town senseless.&#x201C;We are going to make Durban the comedy capital of the country.&#x201D;Whacked boasts big-name corporates as clients when it comes to top tier entertainment and production needs. Its expertise will now be shared with the Durban-based On Fire with Atkins describing the launch as &#x201C;a watershed moment&#x201D;.&#x201C;We are a proudly Durban company. I started five years ago for the sole purpose of providing much-needed stage time for local comics and growing the almost non-existent comedy scene in this hot city.&#x201D;After partnering with marketing and events management specialist Knauf, the pair started hosting comedy evenings at different venues around the city.With comedy clubs firmly established in Joburg and Cape Town with big audiences, Atkins says the Durban comedy scene has exploded.&#x201C;There are more monthly stand-up comedy shows in Durban than ever before, and more local talented acts taking to the stage right here to perform with some of the biggest names in South African comedy, who now have a Durban circuit to play.Also at the event, Savannah confirmed it would be the main sponsors for this year&#x2019;s Durban Summer Comedy Festival, from December 14-17, as well as the Durban Comedy Week events next year.The festival will be held at four venues, at North Beach, in Glenwood and in Morningside, with dozens of comedians arriving from across the country.Atkins said it would be &#x201C;four days of comedy madness&#x201D; when Durbanites can let their hair down and get ready for some good laughs.&#x201C;This sponsorship is a vital boost for our local comedy industry, which has grown,&#x201D; hea said.
