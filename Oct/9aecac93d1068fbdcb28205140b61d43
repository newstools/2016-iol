It seems the president is delusional when he claims there is no crisis, just democracy in action, writes Malaika wa Azania.Johannesburg - There have been many times when I have wondered whether the president of the Republic of South Africa really lives within the borders of this country.Not too long ago, in an interview with eNCA, he claimed apartheid had been buried in 1994 and South Africa was not a racist country but a country with &#x201C;a few&#x201D; racist individuals.As I listened to him make these preposterous assertions, I wondered whether he read the reports released by Statistics SA and other institutions, demonstrating the exact opposite of what he was so bravely claiming.I wondered whether he knew the depth of institutional racism that characterises the country&#x2019;s institutions of learning - both at basic education level and in higher education - or the deep levels of segmentation in the labour market.I wondered whether he ever travelled around the country and the debilitating reality of the black condition.This past week, I found myself wondering the same thing when I listened to the president claiming there is no crisis in South Africa.According to him, every disturbance we see in the country, from the internal battles of the ANC that have claimed the lives of many comrades to the #FeesMustFall protests that are tearing the country asunder, is a demonstration of &#x201C;democracy at work&#x201D;.To the president, we should not be alarmed by the downward spiral in which our country is going.We should rather marvel at how great a model of democracy we are. We should applaud this democracy that is apparently working.In the world that I and many South Africans live, things could not be further from his perfect democracy.It was on Tuesday afternoon that I heard him making these statements. The night before, I had found myself running for dear life as police opened fire on students at Rhodes University.Several students were shot and others were injured in stampedes, as they tried to run away from stun grenades and tear gas.A close friend of mine, Tiego Thotse, fell down and hurt himself badly. For hours, we sat in my flat trying to stop the bleeding from his right foot.With us was another student, comrade Phunguphungu, who had been shot in the hand as he tried to shield himself from a rubber bullet that was fired at close range.His friend had been shot in the head and he was trying to prevent the same fate when the bullet tore into his middle finger - leaving him bloody and bruised.Throughout the night, police roamed through the university in marked and unmarked vehicles.The atmosphere at the university has been one of absolute terror.The smallest university in South Africa has been turned into a battleground.Every university in the country is in what can only be described as a state of war.On the one hand, we have militarisation of learning institutions and, on the other, destruction by students.Since the #FeesMustFall protests started just over a year ago, nearly every university has been torched or vandalised in some way.The damage totals hundreds of millions. But it is not only the infrastructure that has been damaged - it is the higher education sector of South Africa.It is going to take a very long time for our country to recover from this catastrophe - if we ever do.History is littered with many examples of countries that have experienced the same challenges and never could recover.The crisis does not end with higher education. The economy of South Africa is experiencing extreme difficulty.For the past few years, it has not been growing adequately and the Reserve Bank has predicted poor growth.This contraction of the economy has compounded the already alarming crisis of unemployment that is affecting young people in particular.This crisis exists alongside high levels of poverty.According to Statistics SA, millions of South Africans continue to live below the national poverty line of less than $2.26 (R31.60) a day.Despite the significant interventions that have been made by the state, the health-care sector continues to be in a state of emergency.By Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi&#x2019;s own admission, 84 percent of South Africans received second-rate health care, while the privileged 16 percent access a private health-care system that is largely unregulated and, as a result, charges exorbitantly.The housing crisis, which is rooted in apartheid spatial planning, continues to define the face of the new South Africa, with millions of families across the country still living in informal settlements, hostels and overcrowded formal houses.The City of Cape Town alone has a backlog of about 350 000 houses.The number stands at nearly half a million for Joburg. The statistics are not any better across the country.I could go on and on about the monumental challenges that different sectors of the economy are facing. All of them are at, or near, crisis point.This is clearly demonstrated by the endless service delivery protests and other protests that happen in the country on a daily basis.At the forefront of these protests are young people who, marginalised from the economy and denied access to education, find themselves forced to fight a government that has consistently shown disregard for the poorest of the poor.Those without the courage to fight their government resort to crime to survive, and to nyaope to numb themselves.But none of this is a crisis. Apparently South Africa is not a country on shaky ground.It is a &#x201C;young democracy&#x201D;, whose growth is characterised by collapsing institutions, a youth majority that is increasingly marginalised from the economy and systematic inequalities that are crippling the majority of the population.South Africa is not a country in crisis, it is simply a country with a &#x201C;healthy democracy&#x201D; that is in action. I am not a medical doctor, but I know the definition of delusional disorder.It is a serious mental illness called a psychosis, in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined.The main feature of this disorder is the presence of delusions, unshakeable beliefs in something untrue or not based upon reality.I think, based on this definition and our president&#x2019;s unshakeable belief in things not based upon reality, it is safe to say that not all the sick are in hospital - some walk among us. Some lead us.But there is apparently no crisis in this - it is simply democracy in action.
