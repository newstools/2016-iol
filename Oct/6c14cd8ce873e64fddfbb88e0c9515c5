Hamburg - Eight hours in the air is already torture for most people. But there are flights that take twice as long as that. The current record is held by a long-haul direct flight from Auckland to Dubai with Emirates with a distance of 14.718km. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the flight from New Zealand to the Gulf takes 17 hours and 20 minutes - as of September 2016, there is no other journey on offer that has passengers in the sky for so long. Following close behind, at 17 hours and 5 minutes and 13.293km, is Saudia airline's flight from Los Angeles to Riyadh, taking passengers from the US West Coast to the Arabian Peninsula. In third place is the Air India flight from New Delhi to San Francisco - which takes 17 hours and covers a distance of 12.402km. Next up is Dallas to Sydney with Qantas (16 hours and 50 minutes over 13.790km) and Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles with Etihad (16 hours and 45 minutes, 13.494km). In 2015, Emirates announced a new route from Dubai to Panama City, which they say will take the top spot as the longest flight in the world - at 17 hours and 45 minutes. The flight was originally planned to be launched in February 2016, but the airline has pushed it back - leaving New Zealand to Dubai at the top spot for the time being. DPA
