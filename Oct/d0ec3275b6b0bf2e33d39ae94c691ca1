Cape Town &#x2013; The Democratic Alliance will report Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane for violating the Executive Ethics Code, the party said on Sunday.In a reply to a DA parliamentary question, Van Rooyen denied visiting the politically connected Gupta family&#x2019;s compound in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, in the run up to his disastrous brief appointment as finance minister, DA spokesman Kevin Mileham said.&#x201C;Yet, reports today [Sunday] indicate that Van Rooyen met the Gupta&#x2019;s at their residence not once but seven times. Clearly he was misleading in his reply and in so doing he has contravened the Executive Ethics Code.&#x201D;Section 2.3(a) of the code stated that &#x201C;members of the executive may not (a) wilfully mislead the legislature to which they are accountable&#x201D;.&#x201C;The DA will now report Van Rooyen to the Public Protector adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane for this violation of the act,&#x201D; Mileham said.Details in the Sunday Times newspaper indicated that his appointment as co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister could have been part of a longer term plan to allow Gupta-linked companies gain access to the more than R400-billion in municipal spending, and that Van Rooyen&#x2019;s appointment was merely another way for them to achieve this outcome.&#x201C;These latest allegations further demonstrate that the minister is little more than a puppet those strings are pulled to allow access to state funds for the benefit of [President Jacob] Zuma and his cronies.&#x201D;The DA would also submit parliamentary questions to Van Rooyen to determine:&#x2013; whether there had been any discussions between himself and his adviser Ian Whitley and/or Trillian Capital Partners CEO Eric Wood regarding the use of municipal assets to secure private debt financing for municipalities?&#x2013; the nature of his relationship with the Gupta&#x2019;s and their known associates; and&#x2013; whether he in fact did meet the Gupta&#x2019;s in the week prior to his appointment as minister of finance?&#x201C;The Democratic Alliance will not allow a minister to get away with misleading Parliament and the people of South Africa. Nor will we permit South Africa&#x2019;s municipalities to be looted by the Gupta&#x2019;s or the ANC,&#x201D; Mileham said.African News Agency (ANA)
