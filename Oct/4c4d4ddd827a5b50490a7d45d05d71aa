Kevin Hart doesn't believe in fame. The 'Central Intelligence' star says the public unfairly "build" celebrities up only to "beat them down" again, like he says they did with Britney Spears when she went through a breakdown in 2007. Speaking at the Sirius XM Town Hall in New York City to promote his new film 'Kevin Hart: What Now?', he said: "This s**t ain't real. It can be snatched from you. Look at how many stars they build up to beat down. "Look at Britney Spears when she was the hottest thing ever. Then Britney went through a meltdown and everybody is like 'Well we don't know about this f***ing chick here.' Then she got back again and everybody was like, 'We love you Britney!' It was like 'What?!' You're f***ing all over the place, people."   And the 37-year-old actor and comedian insists he will always put his children - Hendrix, eight, and Heaven, 11 - first when they're out and about but will be polite about declining pictures or autographs during those times. He added: "It's not like your life changes because of the level of success that you have. At the end of the day people are people. "If you come up to take a picture of me and I'm with my kids, I'm gonna politely tell you, 'Hey man, I appreciate your support, but I'm on daddy time right now.' As a person you should understand that." Meanwhile, Kevin has his own fair share of fans who go to extreme lengths to prove their devotion to him, with one tattooing his back with a picture of the actor's face. He said: "A guy got a tattoo of my face on his lower back. That was weird. I was like, 'I don't know what you did that for, sir. I don't know why it's there. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do after seeing that. I guess thank you.'"  Bang Showbiz
