The hotly anticipated, annual Cosmo Summer Party is back and ready to kick off the Mother City holidays on Saturday, 26 November at Shimmy Beach Club.  This year the Cosmo team is taking things to a whole new level with the biggest party, the biggest names and the coolest theme yet. Entertainment on the night will feature international and local DJ royalty, including homegrown hero Black Coffee.  With his worldwide appeal, recent BET award wins and having hosted the best international residencies, Coffee is the freshest act to have come out of Africa in a long time.  This party will signify the start of his first summer spent at home in years. Other entertainment on the night will be Cape Town born and bred DJ Minx; Jhb-based DJ, presenter and MC, DJ Loyd newcomer on the international scene, Joccie Borg, and much-loved local legend, the versatile and talented Leyton Lee. With the event’s theme of “Slaying in the Summer” guests can get creative yet sexy and glam with slinky bikinis, sarongs, board shorts, tropical prints, flowers in the hair, and anything else that signifies summer, sunshine and parties. * IOL Lifestyle adapted from press release.
