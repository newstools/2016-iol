The Waterfront Theatre College will, for the first time, be holding auditions in Johannesburg. A leading institution in the training for the performing arts, The Waterfront College was founded in 1992 by TV personality Delia Sainsbury and the late Keith Galloway. Situated near the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town, the Collegeis described as an intimate campus boasting 10 multi-purpose studios, two theatre spaces and residence for up to 20 students. The move to hold auditions in Johannesburg, follows an unprecented number of applications from Gauteng students.Says Sainsbury: “Our reputation as a centre of excellence has resulted in a steady increase in learners wishing to further their education with us. “Our alumni are everywhere. They are to be seen in every aspect of the performing arts industry, from television and film, to stage musicals, cabaret and music, to straight plays and radio.” As a by-product of their training programme, the Waterfront Theatre College offers a range of international qualifications in both performance and teaching. “This international accreditation further enhances the opportunities for employment for graduates,,” says Sainsbury. The Johannesburg auditions will be hosted by Stageworx on Tuesday (Oct 11) and Wednesday (Oct 12). To book an audition slot, call Mary Martin 021 418 4600.
