Needham, Massachusetts - Travel website TripAdvisor has received permission from US federal authorities to sell travel-related services to people visiting Cuba. The Needham (NEED'-uhm), Massachusetts-based firm is among just a few companies to receive licenses from the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to provide such services. Democratic President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced on Dec. 17, 2014, they were restoring diplomatic ties, which were broken in 1961 after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba and installed a communist government. The easing of diplomatic relations led to easier travel between the nations, just 90 miles apart. Under federal rules TripAdvisor can book only travel-related services to Cuba for a dozen reasons including cultural, educational, business and family visits. Vacations aren't among them. Services to Cuba should be available within months. AP
