Cape Town - Police have arrested two suspects in connection with a murder close to a popular Mitchells Plain nightclub at the weekend.Two men, aged 34 and 37, appeared in the Mitchells Plain Magistrates&#x2019; Court on Tuesday and the case has been postponed until November 1 for bail information.Tasriq Daniels, 20, was gunned down in the early hours of Saturday morning, at 3.45am, on the corner of Park and Wespoort Road, after a night out with friends nearby Las Vegas Lounge.Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said: &#x201C;It is reported that allegedly the victims were at a club and had been involved in an argument with the suspect.&#x201C;When they left, the suspect smashed the window of the car the victims were travelling in. The three victims got out of the back of the car.&#x201C;[Tasriq] was shot several times, an 18-year-old victim tried to grab the firearm and was shot in his hand while another 20-year-old victim was shot in his stomach.&#x201C;They were all rushed to a nearby hospital for medical treatment where the 20-year-old victim died due to injuries sustained.&#x201D;Celeste April, the owner of Las Vegas Lounge, said that the incident did not take place at or near her club, which had closed at 3:30am.&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know what happened. The club was closed and all patrons had left already, someone then came to tell us that someone was shot close to the garage but when we went to look, there was nothing happening.&#x201C;Everything happened in the space of four to five minutes. He may have been a patron here but we don&#x2019;t know what happens once our patrons leave the club.&#x201D;Daniels&#x2019;s mother Nazley said that their breadwinner has been taken away.Daniels was the eldest of four children.His mom has also lashed out at people on Facebook claiming her son was a gangster.&#x201C;My kind het nog nooit * tronk gesien nie (My child has never been to jail), so how could they say he was gangster?&#x201C;He was well liked and everyone around here knew he had good manners. He was the breadwinner, our star.&#x201C;Tasriq was a loving and caring person. I can&#x2019;t even sleep at night because he lied on my bed every night.&#x201C;It hurts that his younger brothers keep asking when Boeta is coming home,&#x201D; the mom said.
