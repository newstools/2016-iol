A dramatic change of attitude happened with the rise of Biko, writes Sandile Memela.Johannesburg - It is nearly 40 years since the apartheid regime mounted its assault against the freedom and integrity of so-called black newspapers when it silenced The World and Weekend World. Senior journalists, including the editor, were detained without trial.Although some black journalists were subjected to political harassment, it would be misleading to generally bestow upon all or most black editors and journalists the status of being unsung heroes of the Struggle.To a large extent, black newspapers were primarily instruments of a systematic agenda calculated to soften or dilute political conscious-ness among their readers.To assume the detention of a handful of journalists catapulted them to the vanguard of the Struggle lacks an understanding of history.When The World was banned in 1977, big business had to quickly reinvent a substitute that would be a vehicle to tap into the sleeping giant - the black market. Perhaps in its own unique way, the story of the Sowetan, particularly, represents an important milestone in the struggle for self-determination, freedom of thought and expression. It punctuates the sad history of the constraints on so-called black media and its journalists to articulate the hopes and aspirations of the African majority.Significantly, the Sowetan and its predecessors, The Bantu World, The World, the Post and The Mirror, did not develop under African conception, ownership or control. The publications were largely the result of the colonial agenda to spread and co-opt Africans into the Western lifesyle and thought.Their purpose essentially was to dilute anything that was an expression of African radical heritage, history and culture and articulate it from a Western perspective.What this meant was that the publications and their black journalists were, in essence, imitations of European thought and cultural patterns.For example, The Bantu World was founded by a former white farmer, Bertram Paver, who had neither the noble intention to propagate African radicalism nor the desire for self-determination and independence.Instead, not only did he desire for the newspaper to be dominantly in English but he wanted it to propagate news from the standpoint of how Westernisation benefited Africans. While Africans owned 50 percent of the paper, only seven out of 20 pages of the newspaper were in indigenous languages.The first generation of editors and journalists in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s were highly educated and Westernised African gentlemen who enjoyed prestige among the African readership because they were representatives of the white man&#x2019;s way.These black editors - RV Selope Thema (1932-1952), Jacob Nhlapo (1953-1957) and Manasseh Moerane (1962-1973) - were, over the decades, increasingly dependent on white editorial directors who guided and shaped their political orientation and outlook.From the beginning, the so-called black press, its journalists and editors were created and controlled by white money to propagate a white perspective and create an African middle class alienated from its own history, heritage and experiences.After the banning of the liberation movements in 1960, the newspapers did not step into the political vacuum as their primary concern was to make profit and, at the same time, depoliticise the African population.It was into this political void that Steve Biko, Barney Pityana and others stepped, to popularise and mobilise the black community through the philosophy of Black Consciousness. African journalists who worked for The World and Post were reluctant to embrace or reflect Black Consciousness.However, this did not stop Bokwe Mafuna and Harry Nengwekulu from organising them into a politically conscious formation that awakened their political commitment.A dramatic change of attitude happened with the rise of Biko and the rumbles of discontent among students in Soweto in the 1970s, with the introduction of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.As much as Percy Qoboza (editor of The World, 1964-1977) was an outspoken critic of the apartheid regime, he functioned under very strict white editorial control.When The World was banned in 1977, only to be resurrected as the Post in 1981, Qoboza was forced to resign for being &#x201C;uncontrollable&#x201D;. But he was a black liberal who knew how to &#x201C;work within the system&#x201D;.But it is not incorrect to say he epitomised a new phenomenon of growing Struggle consciousness among young and courageous journalists who were banned or imprisoned such as Phil Mthimkhulu, Zwelakhe Sisulu, Mathata Tsedu, Joe Tlholoe, Thami Mazwai and Aggrey Klaaste.They may have won the battle - but not the war - to shift the role of so-called black journalism from the market-oriented profit-making strategy to political activism.Most owners of the press that largely attracted a black audience, including the Rand Daily Mail, were opposed to using the paper to express support for banned organisations such as the ANC and PAC, or articulating political views.The so-called black press was mainly a vehicle, not only to create a black middle class, but a door for white business to get into the black market. Significantly, the first editor of the Sowetan, Joe Latakgomo, was a sports writer whose beat posed no threat to the political regime.The media continues to use sports as an opium of the people. Editors and senior writers in the black press and mainstream media continue to be expected to conform to the interests of capital and thus protect and preserve the unjust economic system.Many were forced to ignore politics and re-adjust to promoting entertainment, sports, general news (crime, sex and scandals) and small business. Although partly true, it is misleading to portray the history of black journalism as primarily about being the custodian of African political aspirations and hopes.It was an accident of history that a few of its journalists were subjected to detention, banishment and imprisonment.Instead, it has to be understood that the black press and its predecessors were not established to pursue what could be considered an authentic African agenda for political self-determination and liberation.In fact, they were vehicles of white control and domination over African thought.The patriarchal capitalist owners did not subsidise the papers for black journalists to be freedom fighters but instruments that would be pivotal in the creation of a black middle class that would act as a buffer between white economic control and the poor African majority.Today the black press has what can be considered an ambivalent relationship with the government, which still raises serious questions about its role in the development of an African state.
