Durban - KwaZulu-Natal is on course to change its image of a province at war with itself. Premier Willies Mchunu announced terms of reference for a commission of inquiry into all political killings, both inter- and intra-party, in Dannhauser, near Mooi River, on Friday.The terms of reference were spelt out at a Taking Legislature to the People sitting. The constitution of the commission follows a series of inter-party engagements to foster a spirit of partnership between the leaders of different political parties .The Office of the Premier will foot the bill for the work of the commission to the tune of up to R15-million.To date, he said, the provincial government s records showed that 12 members of the ANC, three members of the IFP, three members of the National Freedom Party (NFP) and two SACP members had been slain.The political killings spike particularly in the lead-up to to local government elections, when even comrade turns against comrade. Fingers have pointed at the ANC for this scourge, while inter-party violence has been reported between the ANC and IFP, and the IFP and the NFP. In light of the killings, the government resolved to investigate the root causes of the violence. Most of you will recall that on July 21, following my meeting with the Minister of Police, Nathi Nhleko, on July 20, I announced that a process (would) get under way to appoint a commission of inquiry to probe all politically-related murders in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. He commended representatives from all political parties for pulling in the same direction towards realisation of a peaceful province and political climate. I would like to pay tribute to the members of the multiparty intervention committee representing political parties inside and outside the legislature. He conceded that although notable progress had been made in curbing political slayings, pockets of political violence persisted. We have been able to bring back stability in many areas that were ravaged by political violence such as Umtshezi, Nongoma, Ulundi and others, he said.Mchunu commended political leaders for their work in promoting political tolerance, unity, peace, freedom of choice, expression and association before, during and after elections.The terms of reference of the commission, which may be augmented, varied or amended from time to time, include investigating and reporting on the underlying causes for the rise in the murder of politicians; incidents of murder and attempted murder involving politicians - both as victims and suspects - indications whether the incidents are related to political, ethnic, tribal, social or criminal factors or any other internal or external influences; the outcome of any police investigation and prosecution of the incidents; the perceptions of the public, political parties, community structures and communities in respect of the underlying causes of the incidents of murder and the efficacy of policing.The commission s scope of work will include making recommendations to tackling the underlying causes responsible for the rise in the killings; the prevention of future murders; and the roles of all spheres of government and any other pertinent matter.At the conclusion of its work the commission must submit a report no later than 12 months after the date of the proclamation.The formidable team of commissioners includes are advocate Marumo Moerane SC as chairman, Solo Mdledle as secretary, Vasu Gounden as commissioner, and Cheryl Potgieter as commissioner.Sunday Independent
