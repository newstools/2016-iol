The Integrity Commission will soon ask itself if it's not President Zuma they should be probing, writes Mcebisi Ndletyana. Johannesburg - The suspense continues. Now we have to wait for days before reading details of how the Gupta family usurped executive authority and about the extent of Jacob Zuma’s sleazy networks of nepotism. We aren’t entirely in the dark, however. The events leading to Friday signalled that Thuli Madonsela’s report on state capture contains explosive and damaging evidence. What we saw last week is one of those instances where an attempt at suppression actually reveals the truth. Two claims upon which President Zuma based his interdict against the release of Madonsela’s report are particularly noteworthy. One is insufficient time to prepare his input, and another is failure to grant him an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses who gave information to Madonsela. Both claims are wobbly. Madonsela notified Zuma of her investigation back in April. Granted, Zuma possibly didn’t know the exact dates on which Madonsela would seek an audience with him, but he still had adequate time to get his story straight. He knew exactly what Madonsela was probing, which made it even easier for him to anticipate the outcome and prepare his responses. So, testimonies that Madonsela presented to Zuma can’t possibly have been a surprise. Zuma was not ambushed, but was prepared way in advance. That’s what makes his request to interview witnesses, to gain deeper understanding, cunning. He’s feigning ignorance. Those managers of parastatals and public officials that gave Guptas contracts did so on somebody’s instructions, which in some cases were reportedly conveyed to them by Zuma’s son, Duduzani Zuma. Whether or not the instructions were carried through, Zuma would have known from one of the Gupta brothers or Duduzani. The son handles the family business, which burgeoned solely on nepotism. That said, let us assume, though, that Zuma’s questioning of witnesses sought to elicit clarity. It’s not unimaginable that he wouldn’t recall every deal that was illicitly given to the Gupta family in the last seven years. Zuma’s interrogation of witnesses was not the only way to secure further clarity. That’s why Madonsela offered to pass on his questions to the witnesses, but he declined, insisting on facing them directly. The intention of face-to-face meetings, therefore, was to intimidate witnesses, and possibly get them to retract their testimonies. Zuma possibly suspects the identity of some of the witnesses, but it would have been folly of Madonsela to expose them. Zuma is no ordinary man. He is the president, an office that gives him immense power and influence. Witnesses could possibly be victimised, especially if they are employed in the public sector, or their livelihood derives from the party’s deployment. That’s why Luthuli House’s investigation into state capture never really got off the ground. Identities of witnesses would have been disclosed, exposing them to possible victimisation. Pravin Gordhan’s travails are illustrative of what happens to someone who stands in the way of Zuma enriching friends. That was enough to scare away any possible witness from going to Luthuli House. Zuma is panicking. He’s aware that he has, once again, violated his oath of office. Shaun Abrahams’ charging Gordhan of fraud is further indication of that panic. The criminal charge is transparently malicious. Ministers are never charged for irregular expenditure or extending an employee’s contract. Members of Parliament hear of irregular expenditure every year from the auditor-general. Some of it amounts to billions of rand. But, Parliament, or the Minister of Police, has never instructed the Hawks to arrest the minister or the director-general whose department has spent funds irregularly. Gordhan’s is the first, and for a measly R1â€…million nogal. Abrahams has enlisted himself in the service of political malice. He touted Gordhan’s prosecution as a telling example of the NPA’s renewal. “The days of disrespecting NPA decisions are over,” he yelled at the press conference on Tuesday. Is Gordhan’s prosecution really the best way the NPA can demonstrate its diligence? Consider also that  Abrahams kicked off the press conference by telling us how convinced he was that the “rogue unit” set up by Gordhan while he was at Sars was illegal. He listed all the laws that the unit supposedly violated, only to say they were still investigating. How do you possibly announce you’ve discovered wrongdoing, yet turn around to tell us you’re still investigating? Keep in mind that was the initial reason for the probe, which began more than a year ago. Does Abrahams really want us to take him seriously? The goal here is not really to imprison Gordhan. Zuma simply wants him gone. Gordhan is not only clamping down on cronyism, but his department has been immensely helpful to Madonsela’s investigation of state capture. Treasury’s evidence shows Zuma could be guilty of a criminal offence. That renewed Zuma’s determination to get rid of Gordhan. Zuma can’t just fire him, as he’d be personally liable for the backlash by the markets. With these fake charges, Zuma is hoping Gordhan will resign voluntarily out of “shame”. Because he has done no wrong, Gordhan has no reason to feel any shame and thus will not resign. Zuma will have to fire Gordhan himself. That’s a bit tricky. Zuma could claim that the ANC’s 2012 Mangaung resolution on exemplary behaviour warrants Gordhan’s dismissal. That resolution said ANC officials facing legal charges should step down from public office to spare the party’s reputation. Withdrawing from public office, however, is not entirely an individual’s decision. It rests with the Integrity Commission, which is chaired by the revered Andrew Mlangeni. The commission probes the veracity of the charges, and decides whether or not the said official should resign to protect the reputation of the party. Therefore, Mlangeni’s commission should ideally determine Gordhan’s fate. The commission must decide whether keeping Gordhan in his job disgraces the ANC. Mlangeni is no Abrahams. He won’t make a senseless decision.  And a number of ANC leaders, current and former, have already dismissed the charges as mischievous. It’s all up to Zuma. If he wants Gordhan gone, he must fire him. But firing Gordhan won’t solve Zuma’s problems.  He may succeed to get one or two dodgy deals through under a new minister, but he will increase public resentment against him. Gordhan is liked more than he is. Gordhan has never gorged on public money, but has risked being unpopular with officials by cutting down on parties and luxury in the public service to save money for useful things. He has been imploring investors around the world to invest in our ailing economy to create jobs. And what’s Zuma been doing? Hatching a plan to fire Gordhan. That plan might just backfire. Support for Gordhan in his trial is likely to turn into anti-Zuma demonstrations. Even the saintly Ahmed Kathrada, in his grand old-age, has promised to join the march on November 2.  Revelations in Madonsela’s report, possibly in that same week, will widen the anti-Zuma sentiment. Quite soon the Integrity Commission will ask itself if it’s not Zuma they should be probing, instead of Gordhan.
