 Cape Town - Three suspects were arrested over the past weekend in connection with a string of carjackings, robberies and rapes at Cape Town beachfronts, Western Cape police said on Monday. In a statement, the police said the suspects allegedly targeted couples parking at secluded spots in the Strand, Gordon’s Bay, Macassar and Somerset West areas between 3 and 22 September. “It is alleged that three gun wielding men between the ages of 20 and 30 confronted complainants who were sitting in their vehicles on beachfronts in the Strand, Gordon’s Bay and Macassar areas,” said police spokesman FC van Wyk. “The SAPS are currently investigating six reported cases of rape, hijacking and attempted murder.” Two suspects, aged 20 and 24, were arrested following an “intensive intelligence-led investigation” by members of the police’s Khayelitsha cluster, said van Wyk. A third suspect was arrested on Sunday night. The three were expected to appear in the Strand Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Van Wyk said an anti-hijacking task team was investigating the spate of crimes. “The SAPS [SA Police Service] would like to issue a warning to couples not to use secluded and isolated spots to park their vehicles in the evening. We also call upon more victims of similar crimes in these areas to report these incidents.” African News Agency
