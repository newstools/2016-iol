Johannesburg - The South African Policing Union (SAPU) on Monday called on Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to &#x201C;show maturity and leadership by swallowing his pride&#x201D; and reversing the appointment of Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza as the Head of the Directorate of Priority Crimes Investigation - commonly known as the Hawks.In a statement, SAPU said the minister failed to follow procedure in appointing the Hawks boss in that he did not notify the National Assembly within the prescribed period of time.&#x201C;The Minister is called upon to just reverse this controversial appointment,&#x201D; said SAPU.&#x201C;We are on record as voicing our opposition to Ntlemeza&#x2019;s initial appointment from the day the Minister appointed him in an acting capacity. He was never the best candidate to lead an elite unit like the Hawks.&#x201D;The police union said Ntlemeza&#x2019;s poor record was well documented.&#x201C;Our opposition to his appointment is not a personal vendetta. We are only concerned about service delivery as mediocrity will cost the police the respect they deserve. Already the Hawks record is a far cry from what is expected of them,&#x201D; said the statement issued by Oscar Skommere, SAPU General Secretary.&#x201C;A mature leader is the one who acknowledges his mistakes and own them. This is an opportune time for the minister to rectify his initial shortcoming by appointing such a poor commander to lead a vital security organ like the Hawks.&#x201C;General Ntlemeza has been a laughing stock of our time. He doesn&#x2019;t command any respect, even amongst the Hawks ranks, let alone the criminals.&#x201C;The fact that Ntlemeza&#x2019;s appointment is irregular, it can be legally challenged and the Hawks cannot afford to have a poor commander.&#x201D;Both Nhleko and Ntlemeza could not immediately be reached for comment.
