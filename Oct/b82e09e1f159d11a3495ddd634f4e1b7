The 42-year-old pop star has never liked the moniker which she has been known as since her time in the Spice Girls, in which she was also known as Sporty Spice. Melanie dislikes the title because she associates it with negativity. She said: “The Mel C thing has always really bugged me. Because in my brain it links to negative headlines. I don't know why, it just irks me. It's not my name.” As well as wanting to distance herself from the Mel C name, the 'Anymore' singer has also distanced herself from the Spice Girls refusing to reunite with Geri Horner, Emma Bunton and Mel B for new music and a concert to celebrate their 20th anniversary. Melanie admits she does feel “guilty” about spurning the reunion but she just wants to focus on her solo career and the release of her latest album 'Version of Me'. In an interview with The I newspaper, she said: “I feel bad and I feel guilty. There's a lot of negativity that surrounds it and there shouldn't be really. I'm not turning my back on the Spice Girls - I'm very proud of them...” The 'I Turn to You' hitmaker made her decision to not reunite with the Spice Girls after learning that former member Victoria Beckham would not be returning to the group. She said: “It was just irking me that going back as a four-piece didn't quite cut it. With people out of the mix, whoever it is, the dynamic changes. It becomes a very different thing ... It's interesting psychologically.” Bang Showbiz
