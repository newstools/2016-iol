Johannesburg - The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) says the crisis affecting universities called for urgent social dialogue to ensure that thousands of students are able to complete their academic year.Students across the country have been protesting for weeks demanding free education, following Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande&#x2019;s announcement that universities could increase their fees next year but capped the increases at 8%.Nzimande also announced that those students whose parents earned below 600 000 would not face a fee increase.Last week labour federation Cosatu lodged a Section 77 application at Nedlac which cited business, the department of higher education, Treasury, Presidency, churches, students, community, universities&#x2019; management and parents.The first Section 77 meeting on crisis in higher education took place on Thursday with parties agreeing that the crisis facing universities was a socio-economic crisis that need to be resolved.They said there was an urgent need to ensure that students completed the year to allow space for Grade 12 learners to enter the higher education system in 2017.&#x201C;The meeting also agreed it would be urgent for all pending criminal cases against arrested students to be expedited and that every possible effort be made to ensure all students, including those arrested be able to write their exams,&#x201D; said Nedlac in a statement on Friday.Parties said the recent announcement by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan which will see the National Student Financial Aid being given an additional R9.2 billion and universities an additional R7.6 billion, had to be factored in during discussions.The next Nedlac meeting on the fees matter will take place on November 3. @ZintleMahlatiLabour Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
