The Hawks have denied pursuing former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel over a multi-million rand contract he approved at the South African Revenue Service while he was heading the Treasury.Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said he did not know about reports on Thursday on an investigation into Manuel.The Citizen reported that the Hawks were probing Manuel over the modernisation contract he approved at Sars without following due processes.Earlier the Citizen posted a video in which Manuel has dismissed as rubbish claims by Mzwanele Manyi of the Deconolisation Foundation, who laid corruption charges against Manuel.Mulaudzi said he did not know about an investigation into Manuel. However, he confirmed that Manyi submitted a dossier to the Hawks.&#x201C;The dossier has been given to us, it is a subject of an inquiry. It is still early to say what will happen. It will take us some time,&#x201D; said Mulaudzi.Manuel will be the second top ANC figure to be probed by the Hawks over Sars matters.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was a subject of an investigation by the Hawks over the Sars rogue unit.But two weeks ago the National Prosecuting Authority charged Gordhan with fraud for approving the early retirement of former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.Abrahams came under fire from MPs last week for charging Gordhan for allegedly flouting the Public Finance Management Act when there were many public servants who have wasted tens of millions of rands in violation of the act.Manuel stepped down from government in 2014 after serving in Cabinet for many years.Independent Media
