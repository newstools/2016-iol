The sportswear giant’s Perfect Never campaign aims to encourage women to use physical activity as a way to “escape” from social pressures. The blonde bleauty was captain of her high school’s volleyball team and admitted that being active is the ‘’only time” her mind is at peace. "When I was a competitive athlete, I used to be so focused on being perfect that my coaches would take me out of competing all together. I'd focus on my mistakes which would breed more missteps - a domino effect. Until I learned to change the channel, to re-focus, re-set. It was my mistakes, my imperfections that motivated me most."  Gigis is also a strong believer that Reebok's three prominent principles that exercise holds social, physical and mental benefits of fitness is on point. "Working out isn't only physical for me. It's mental. It helps me escape the noise in my head. It's the only time my mind goes quiet."
