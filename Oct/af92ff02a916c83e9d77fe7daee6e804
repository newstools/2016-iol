 Rustenburg - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) boycotted the Rustenburg special council meeting on Friday, where Mpho Khunou was re-elected unopposed as the mayor. Khunou resigned from his position on Tuesday, following a high court bid by the Democratic Alliance (DA) that forced the municipality Speaker Shiela Mabale-Huma to resign a week ago. The DA approached the court to set aside Mabale-Huma’s election as speaker, citing that her election on August 19, was unlawful. The party maintained that presiding officer Seth Ramagaga was supposed to have adjourned the meeting when the results for the speaker ended in a tie. Instead Ramagaga called for a re-run, where Mabale-Huma beat Boswa Ledwaba from the Forum 4 Service Delivery by 46 votes against 43 to take the position. The court application was expected to be heard in Mahikeng on Thursday, but Mabale-Huma resigned last week and the court bid fell away. Khunou and single whip Lekgotla Mataboge resigned on Tuesday to avoid another court application as Mabale-Huma’s election was deemed to be irregular, tainting the election of the mayor and the single whip. Mabale-Huma was then re-elected Speaker unopposed on Tuesday, after opposition parties staged a walk-out. EFF councillor Abinaar Matlhako had objected to the acting municipal manager of Rustenburg, Victor Makona, presiding over the meeting, saying he was not fit and proper because his contract with the municipality expired on September 30. The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and Forum 4 Service Delivery (F4SD) did not attend the meeting, but Rocky Malebana-Metsing and Pogiso Bothomane from the F4SD did send their apologies to the council. Khunou named the same mayoral committee team he had announced a month ago. African News Agency
