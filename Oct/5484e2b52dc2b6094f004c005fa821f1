 APPLE has been named the biggest corporate tax avoider in the US after sending £171.6 billion of profits offshore last year. A report showed the tech giant saved £51.1 billion that it should have paid in tax, thanks to its convoluted arrangements. It also revealed that in 2015 three quarters of the Fortune 500 firms – the largest corporations in America – hold £1.9 trillion of income in offshore tax havens. This amounted to £561.9 billion in American tax that they avoided paying. The study, by pressure group Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, showed that the top 30 tax avoiders in the US operated 2,509 tax haven subsidiary companies. Apple came top of the list with three foreign subsidiaries, all in Ireland, but the firm constituted £171.6 billion of profit booked overseas. The report also highlighted Nike, which holds £8.3 billion offshore, while Goldman Sachs had £21.9 billion in foreign companies. Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has called attempts to make it pay more tax ‘political crap’ and has said the firm follows the law. The study came just days after Apple announced it is building a centre for 1,400 staff in Battersea Power Station.  Daily Mail
