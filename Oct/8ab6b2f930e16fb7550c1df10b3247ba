Durban - Two KwaZulu-Natal adventurers, retracing the footsteps of John Ross&#x2019;s 1827 journey to collect medicines, were temporarily arrested for, ironically, smuggling drugs across the border between Mozambique and South Africa.Legend has it that Ross walked from Durban to Maputo, as the two cities are now called, and back to fetch medicines back in 1827.Now, 189 years later, a Mozambican soldier arrested adventurers Thommo Hart and Simphiwe Ngcobo when he found them off course near the Ponta do Ouro border.&#x201C;He thought we were drug smugglers,&#x201D; Hart said, after being stopped at a route used by illegal border jumpers.&#x201C;We had been walking about 1km up and down sand dunes when suddenly a loud voice shouted at us.&#x201C;Simphiwe tried to talk to him in Zulu and tell him what we were doing and how we ended up on this path, but things only got worse.&#x201D;Eventually, a local came to their rescue and, in Portuguese, negotiated their freedom to proceed.That seemed only a warm-up for the two as a series of arrests followed by &#x201C;soldiers who popped out of nowhere&#x201D; every couple of 100m.Finally they were handed over to a &#x201C;commander&#x201D;.&#x201C;We were escorted to a run-down office in a run-down old military building. There were three people, the commander, a woman in army uniform and what we think is the person in charge of the border post or the police.&#x201D;Much attention was given to a statement with their names written on it.&#x201C;In the background of the office was an old television set showing Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson acting in a 1990s movie, dubbed into Portuguese.&#x201D;The two focused on the movie as the officials argued with one another about their two captives and took orders from Maputo, with Ngcobo trying to explain their mission.Ngcobo is walking to raise funds for the Empilweni Physically Challenged Community Centre at kwaNdengezi, near Durban, and Hart is raising funds for the Pink Drive, a cancer charity, and attempting to break a barefoot running distance record.LaughingOnce across the border, South African officials told them they all knew the short skinny commander on the Mozambique side and that he had &#x201C;control issues&#x201D;.&#x201C;We just laughed,&#x201D;said Hart.The two were grateful to receive permission to walk from Kosi Bay to Maphelane in the iSimangaliso National Park, making sure to make minimal impact on surroundings.Hart explained the rules: &#x201C;No penetration of dune forests, no damage to dune vegetation, no fishing, no collection of any marine life, removal of all waste and leave no trace of human engagement or activity in the wilderness area.&#x201D;One day, a lightning storm caught them off guard, forcing them to pitch their tent near Leven Point.&#x201C;There were two moments on this stretch that both of us will remember for ever.&#x201C;As the sun was setting behind a dune, there was a moment where the wind stopped and everything was silent except the waves crashing on the shore. In this moment, the light was perfect... a golden glaze across the wet sand and waves, while hundreds of crabs tried to avoid us.&#x201C;The dunes towering above us were lit on fire in a mixture of gold and red. On the horizon the full moon was creating a light blue effect across the sea.&#x201D;Hart said the other moment was at midnight when the full moon was at its brightest, lighting up the sand dunes in a light blue colour.&#x201C;It looked out of this world, as though we were on the moon itself.&#x201D;Their arrival at St Lucia as high tide reached its peak was &#x201C;emotional&#x201D;, Hart said.&#x201C;I had a hundred cuts on the soles of my feet and had a rock fall on to to my ankle, which is now swollen.&#x201D;Reflecting on their journey down the far northern KwaZulu-Natal stretch of coastline, Hart said he was now questioning why Ross - whose real name was Charles Maclean - walked down the beach.&#x201C;What were his reasons for deciding to walk along the beach, or did he just keep to the shorelines of the lakes inland? If his reason was to put less pressure on his bare feet, then surely he would have experienced the pain we experienced on the rocks.&#x201C;It would also have been a high risk in terms of (fresh) water resources.&#x201D;Hart wonders whether he had been influenced by Zulu king, Shaka who provided Ross with escorts and who, according to Hart, may have been &#x201C;looking for a natural harbour to create his own port kingdom to trade ivory&#x201D;.
