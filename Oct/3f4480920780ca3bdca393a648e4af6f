Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s rise to power has been accompanied by a bizarre commentary of self-obsession and self-congratulation, writes Geoff Hughes. Education has become “a highly contested commodity”, with campuses in flames and invaded by thuggery, violence and fear. This is a far cry from the promise of the New South Africa. Two current populist leaders exemplify starkly different attitudes to education. When Julius Malema first rose to prominence, he was much mocked for poor matric results. “The inconvenient youth” as he was called, rewrote his exams, went to university and graduated. But he needed no tuition in political acumen or rhetoric, which earned him an invitation to the Oxford Union. In Parliament he has become a commanding subversive figure, coining original formations like “Zuptas” and “Dudu Myeni Zuma”, even haranguing  ANC “stalwarts” on their constitutional duties. By contrast, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the self-proclaimed wonder-worker of the SABC, not only failed matric but lied about it, and has assured everybody that he “is not going back to school”. His mysterious rise, and more extraordinary re-rise, to power has been accompanied by a uniquely bizarre commentary of self-obsession and self-congratulation. He seems unafflicted by doubt, indeed he has a hubris in his extraordinary achievements. The real questions are: Who is keeping him in power and what are his qualifications? * Geoff Hughes is an emeritus professor, formerly with Wits University. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
