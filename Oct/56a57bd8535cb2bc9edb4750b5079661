Johannesburg - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse has branded ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe's comments, made on Wednesday, about revisiting the e-toll decision, as "disingenuous and farcical". Outa chairman Wayne Duvenage said it would not be the first time that the ANC would be revisiting the controversial scheme since the public uproar began in early 2010. "We met with Mr Mantashe and many other officials soon after Outa interdicted the launch of the scheme in 2012," Duvenage said, "and pointed out numerous issues that would eventually bring the scheme to its knees." The scheme's compliance is now less than 20 percent and its debt has risen to more than R8 billion. "It's time to stop the rhetoric of revisiting and cancel the scheme," insisted Duvenage. "You can't be half pregnant on this - you either toll or you don't. "Our research and paper presented to Premier David Makhura's e-Toll Panel in 2014 (another talk shop), highlighted eight critical success factors for e-Tolls schemes to work. Sanral's scheme failed to tick a single box, all of which has given rise to the schemes failure." Outa contends that most of the 20 percent of road users who actually pay e-tolls are corporate fleets and rental companies, who merely pass the costs on to their customers. If they refused to pay, as the general public has done, it suggests, the trickle of income to the companies connected to the e-Toll scheme would dry up, and the decision would be easier to make.
