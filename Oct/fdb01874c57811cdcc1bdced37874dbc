Pretoria - The Black First Land First (BLF) will forcefully take land in South Africa as Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe did, the movement’s leader, Andile Mngxitama, said on Thursday. “Land doesn’t come through voting. Those who say vote for us and we will give you your land are lying to you. If you want land, you take it. You take the land. Forward with President Robert Mugabe,” Mngxitama told supporters ahead of a march to the office of the Public Protector in Pretoria. “We’re going to follow the president of Zimbabwe. We take the land by force. We’re not going to buy this land because it was stolen from us. The ANC is scared of white people.” Mngxitama said his organisation was marching to the office of outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela because she had refused to investigate a report alleging that R26 billion was siphoned out of the Reserve Bank during apartheid. “Before we take the land, we need to have that money. Thuli Madonsela doesn’t want to give us our money. That is our money stolen by white people from the Reserve Bank. That R26 billion belongs to all of you,” said Mngxitama. “That is the money for free education. We’re saying Thuli Madonsela can investigate government or the Guptas, but whites in this country must also be investigated.” BLF deputy national convenor Zandile Lwana said Madonsela had had a dismal performance in her seven-year non-renewable tenure which expires this month.
