Hong Kong - Expansion plans are advancing for Hong Kong's international airport which will see a huge shopping and entertainment complex called Skycity built on the site. The goal is to make the “Airport Town” northeast of the terminals and runways a tourist destination in its own right, with shops, restaurants, hotels and more set to spring up starting in 2021, comments Swiss-based aviation industry journal Aerotelegraph. Almost 70 million passengers pass through Hong Kong International Airport annually. This is expected to rise to more than 100 million by 2030, according to the airport authority and a third runway is being built. London consultancy company Skytrax named Hong Kong the fifth best airport in the world this year - following Singapore, Seoul, Munich and Tokyo. DPA
