Johannesburg- Cobras skipper Omphile Ramela has been found guilty of Clause 6.3.1 (f) of the CSA Code of Conduct and has been suspended for two Sunfoil Series four-day matches, one of which is suspended for one calendar year. This makes him ineligible for selection for the Cape Cobras Sunfoil Series match against the Dolphins to be played at Boland Park from Thursday To Sunday. “I have taken into account the fact that Mr Ramela admitted the offence and has accepted that his behaviour was inappropriate,” commented CSA disciplinary commissioner, professor Rian Cloete. “Therefore, having taken all factors into account, it is important that an effective penalty be imposed and that it is fundamentally important for disciplinary action to correct behaviour. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appropriate penalty in respect of this offence, which is a level 2 offence, is a suspension for two matches, of which one (1) match is suspended for one calendar year.” African News Agency (ANA)
