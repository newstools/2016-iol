Gasant Abarder speaks to Helen Zille about her tell-all book, Not Without a Fight, and, as usual, is slightly intimidated.Cape Town - There&#x2019;s a great scene in one my favourite films, The Lion King, when the hyena henchmen shudder at the mere mention of Mufasa&#x2019;s name.I&#x2019;ve had that same sense of foreboding when my phone rings and the caller line identity reads &#x201C;Helen Zille&#x201D; on the screen.It&#x2019;s time to be Zille&#x2019;d. If you&#x2019;ve written something about her, get ready to have your ducks in a row. (Even the most seasoned journo has confessed to cold sweats. A senior editor on a Sunday publication once said he didn&#x2019;t bother writing stories about, or on, Zille. The fallout wasn&#x2019;t worth it.)The truth is, when I began my first stint as editor of this newspaper in 2009 as a 31-year-old, I was not ready for Helen Zille.I started as editor a month before she became premier in her first term and no one had warned me about these Helen Zille calls.As I made my way to 7 Wale Street for this interview about her tell-all book, Not Without a Fight, I still wasn&#x2019;t ready.But as many a journo who has been Zille&#x2019;d knows, the engagement is part of making you think harder as a journalist. She doesn&#x2019;t suffer fools.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m completely relaxed if people have a different opinion from me, I really don&#x2019;t mind that. I&#x2019;m a great believer in the famous aphorism that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but no one is entitled to their own facts. Facts are facts.&#x201C;I get really frustrated when journalists are sloppy and misquote or just get the facts wrong. I don&#x2019;t like that. I expect people to do their jobs professionally.&#x201D;The calls would come at any hour. A predecessor revealed regular Zille visits at his doorstep at 5am &#x201C;for a chat&#x201D;.Once, I protested I was on leave when a particular story-in-question earned me a Zille call. Her response was something to the effect that she, as premier, couldn&#x2019;t argue the same when she was being held accountable. Fair play!&#x201C;I wrote a book in eight months while doing this full-time job. I had to work very hard on that book and get up early every morning almost and write - every spare moment, in the back of a car. It was a big book to write.&#x201C;I just expect people to be professional. When there are mistakes, I&#x2019;ll phone them up and chat to them. And I try and do my work properly. It&#x2019;s not as if I don&#x2019;t make mistakes. Of course I do, but I get a lot of stuff done. When I need to get something done, I get something done.&#x201C;My deadline was first going to be at the end of this year. Then (the publishers) moved it forward to July, then to the end of April. So, you can imagine, I had to kill myself to get that done in eight months. It was a big thing.&#x201D;I haven&#x2019;t read her autobiography yet, save for an extract about the failed Mamphela Ramphela merger that was punctuated with &#x201C;that kiss&#x201D;.The tone is typically Zille, and not even husband Johan is spared her pedantic scrutiny (as she points out a mangled quote in his assessment of that failed merger).But I did have the chance to see an extract of chapter 9 about the infighting in the DA. If you&#x2019;re one of her existing cabinet colleagues in the cabal she writes about, it makes for uncomfortable reading.&#x201C;Chapter 9 - the battle for the soul of the DA. I manage the relationships very well because I say in that chapter, at the very end, it would be a valid question to ask me how come I can work so well with people when we are in opposing camps to this kind of extent?&#x201C;I said there were many reasons, but one of them is that people actually change. They do change. I really think that those people who are still with the DA really imbibed our political philosophy now and we&#x2019;re on the same path.&#x201C;There is no way you can grow as a political party if you can&#x2019;t convert people, and I think lots of people are really converted to our philosophy.&#x201D;There were also many theories why Zille stepped down when she did, making way for Mmusi Maimane to eventually become leader at the next elective conference. Was she pushed, as some had suggested?&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve written a whole chapter about that. It was just the right time to do that. Athol (Trollip) was going to stand as chairman and I knew he was going to win and I decided it was important to have a more diverse leadership, so I stepped back. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201C;I had been nominated unopposed for the leadership and then I stood back.&#x201D;Maimane delivered in his first assignment for the DA - the local government elections. The DA now runs Tshwane, Joburg, Nelson Mandela Bay and has shored up its strongholds in the Cape.Surely, this bodes well for the DA at the general elections in 2019. Zille, however, is pragmatic about what the future holds at the next national polls.&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t compare local government elections to national elections. In local government elections the ANC suffers from a massive stay-away. Three million people who voted ANC in 2014 didn&#x2019;t vote in this last election.&#x201C;We actually got more votes in 2014 than 2016, but it&#x2019;s that differential turnout that makes a huge difference in local government elections.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a different kind of challenge in the national elections. But lots of things are going to happen between now and 2019, especially to the ANC, which is in the process of disintegration and, I think, irreversibly.&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll have to see what happens, but the ANC usually tended to do better in national elections than local elections. We&#x2019;re growing and growing, the DA is on the road. Urban South Africa is becoming political, which is good, because urban South Africa is the economy of South Africa.&#x201D;I had questions about Helen writing a tell-all book, with some revelations about colleagues she still works with, in the middle of her second term as premier. Is she about to step down?&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m just putting it all together. I&#x2019;m being quite honest about things. You need to be honest about things whether you&#x2019;re in office or not. There is no lie anywhere in that book.&#x201C;The book and my position as premier have nothing to do with each other as far as I&#x2019;m concerned. I&#x2019;d ideally like to start a political school for the DA. I really would like to do that.&#x201D;Believe it or not, there are things that scare Helen Zille. And she&#x2019;s confirmed what her predecessor Lynne Brown once revealed to me: Leeuwenhof is haunted.&#x201C;Of course it&#x2019;s haunted! There are lots of ghosts there. Ek het al klaar die plek gekies waar ek gaan kom spook. My husband and I have chosen our room where we&#x2019;re going to come and spook in. It&#x2019;s the family room upstairs, we love that room. It has a beautiful view and it&#x2019;s a lovely, lovely room.&#x201C;One day I was walking down the steps and as you come down the steps inside the house you can only see half of the lounge window. It was the very early morning - it was still dark in the middle of winter - one of the blinds just started going up. So I turned around and dashed upstairs.&#x201C;Later on, when it was light, I came down and said, Do you know what happened?&#x2019;&#x201C;I told them and Sandra (one of the ladies who works at Leeuwenhof) started laughing and said: It was me, I was just rolling up the blinds but you couldn&#x2019;t see me, I was on the outside.&#x2019; &#x201C;But I just turned around, darted upstairs and locked the door. When I told my family afterwards, my son said to me sardonically: Oh ma, locking the door is a very well known strategy against ghosts&#x2019;.&#x201D;Helen has been a journo (which probably explains her wont for calling them up to be Zille&#x2019;d), an education MEC, a mayor of Cape Town and premier of the Western Cape twice over.But her family ranks as the highlight of her life.&#x201C;The most rewarding thing for me is having a happy, close and functional family. That, by far, has been the most rewarding in my life. I&#x2019;ve now got a wonderful daughter-in-law as well and just having a functional, close family means a lot.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got two boys who are contributing to society. It&#x2019;s just such a blessing.&#x201D;If you&#x2019;ve seen Zille on Twitter, you&#x2019;d wonder whether she knows of the delete button or backspace key on her smartphone. But she admits to sometimes writing tweets, then deleting them.Personally, I don&#x2019;t think some of her behaviour on Twitter befits her standing as a premier. But make no mistake: she loves it.I suggest to her she&#x2019;s made of Teflon because of some the insults aimed at her. And, quite frankly, it would be better too if she had deleted some of her tweets before posting them.&#x201C;Sometimes I fight back and people get all upset when I fight back. I&#x2019;ve got so used to it now that it really is duck&#x2019;s water off my back, as someone once famously said. I used to worry about my children and that sort of thing, but now they shrug it off too. They know it&#x2019;s nonsense.&#x201C;The Twitter space is for verbal sparring. I like the verbal sparring, I like the intellectual debate, the jousting. I think I can make some very strong points in 140 characters.&#x201C;I block some people, ja, who are beyond the pale and are not interested in rationality.&#x201D;She is regarded in circles as the &#x201C;Iron Lady&#x201D; of South African politics. But Helen believes South Africa, despite the challenges, is on the right path.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not worried (about South Africa) because we&#x2019;re much closer to becoming a sustainable democracy than we were 20 years ago. There isn&#x2019;t one overwhelmingly dominant party anymore.&#x201C;Our institutions are mostly standing up and haven&#x2019;t been captured by the dominant party yet. The opposition is growing. We&#x2019;ve shown that policies make the difference in terms of economic growth and jobs, which is why the Western Cape has 10&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2030;percent less unemployment than other provinces.&#x201C;And we&#x2019;re going to establish checks and balances and economic growth.&#x201C;What I&#x2019;m worried about is our school system, where we&#x2019;re battling so much to get improvement. What I&#x2019;m worrying about is the dysfunctionality of so many families, the abuse of alcohol and drugs - that is very, very worrying to me and the fact that (we lack) a whole of society approach, where you have to rely on the parents fulfilling their responsibility and every cog in the wheel fulfilling their particular responsibility.&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t got that sense. We&#x2019;re not a country with a culture of accountability; where everyone is held accountable for what they&#x2019;re supposed to do. Everyone will look at the government and say: What are you doing for me?&#x2019;. But there is little understanding of just how much you have to do for yourself and your own family.&#x201D;So Helen is stoic. If you&#x2019;ve been Zille&#x2019;d, like me, you may have stronger words to describe her. But beneath the hard first impression lies a sharp wit and sense of humour.&#x201C;I love cooking curries, any kind. I love cooking out of an Indian cookbook that I&#x2019;ve probably had for 30 years. When I finished my book, my son said one thing he was really pleased about is that this isn&#x2019;t a cookbook that my mother wrote&#x2019;.&#x201C;John Steenhuisen (DA chief whip in Parliament) picked up that line and at my book launch he got up and said: I&#x2019;m sure everybody here is very grateful that this isn&#x2019;t a cookbook&#x2019;.&#x201D; Gasant Abarder is the editor of the Cape Argus.
