Johannesburg – Protesters marching under the banner of #OutsourcingMustFall on Friday took their demands for a minimum wage of R10 000 a month to the Gauteng Department of Health, the Department of Basic Education and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Organisers said their march came after weeks of mass meetings with workers in several industries including Prasa, Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP), Jozi@work, Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges, Community Work Programme and community health clinics. In their memorandum handed to the health and education departments, Prasa and Joburg City council, the workers demand an end to “outsourcing” and labour broking. They are also demanding a R10 000 per month minimum wage, the immediate reinstatement of all workers recently retrenched through termination of contracts with service providers and that there must be no job losses. They further demand the termination of all contracts with contractors and service providers and the employment of all the outsourced workers by COJ on a permanent, full-time basis with decent pay and conditions. Mametlwe Sebei, a member of the #OutsourcingMustFall and the Workers & Socialist Party said the march is also about the conditions of the community healthcare workers. He claimed that the workers in the health sector were most affected by outsourcing. Sebei said workers are facing “ruthless forms exploitation and slavery”. “There is no security of employment, there are no decent wages and no clear working hours” he said. About 30 workers took part in the march on Friday. African News Agency
