The Mamre Garden Club was started by a group of enthusiastic gardeners from Cape Town with the aim of getting as many people from the community involved in this project as possible. The membership has grown to 40 this year and we will be breaking the competition up into 2 sections, new gardens and established gardens making things more fair. The top 3 gardens in each section will be open to the public on Friday 28 and Saturday 29 October. READ: The health benefits of gardening This will enable members to show off their gardens, arts and crafts and earn some much needed money for themselves. As the saying goes "teach a man to fish and you feed him for life". I certainly hope we are doing that for them. Signboards will be used to direct the people to the nursery from both entrances to Mamre.  An example of what Winnie Fortuin’s (aged 70) garden looked like before the transformation.
