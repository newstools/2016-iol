Cape Town - A two-year-old boy died tragically when he was hit by a stray gang bullet while in his mother&#x2019;s arms.The bullet that killed little Braydon first went through his mother, Rostan Graff&#x2019;s, arm before entering the little boy&#x2019;s chest.The child died as a neighbour was running with him to the nearest hospital.The incident occurred on Saturday night in Robinvale, Atlantis, where a third person, a 23-year-old man, was also shot and wounded as gangsters opened fired on each other.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that cases of murder and attempted murder were being investigated, with no arrests yet.Police sources say a bloody turf war between the Americans and the 28s gangs is responsible for the toddler&#x2019;s death.On Sunday Braydon&#x2019;s devastated family gathered around a grieving Rostan who had been released from hospital earlier in the day.Grandmother Geraldine Moses said Braydon and Graff, 24, were on their way to visit his father when the gunfight broke out.&#x201C;Minutes after they left, we heard three gunshots and people rushed into our house for cover,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;Soon afterwards, Rostan came back into the house holding Braydon, screaming that he had been shot.&#x201C;There was no car around so one of the neighbours grabbed him and ran with him all the way to the Wesfleur Hospital [about five minutes away] but he was already dead when they got there.&#x201C;Rostan was hysterical, she kept screaming that we go and get the child from hospital, that he was not dead, if we could just pray for him, he would be OK,&#x201D; she said, sobbing.Graff told the Daily Voice that she ran for cover, not realising she and her son had been shot.&#x201C;I only noticed it when he said eina mommy&#x2019; and then I felt the blood flowing down my body and I just ran for home,&#x201D; she explained with tears streaming down her face.&#x201C;I only realised I had also been shot later, when the shock wore off. The bullet that went through my arm is the same that hit his chest.&#x201C;I was so numb with shock and fear, I remember praying that he be OK, that God should rather take me and that I should be the one who died, not him.The mother added: &#x201C;He was a sweet, innocent child who loved playing with others, everywhere you saw him he was holding the hand of some other child, singing I love you, you love me&#x2019;. He was a lovable child.&#x201D; Daily Voice IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
