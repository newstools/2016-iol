London - With her immaculately groomed long dark locks and dignified poise, she has the same attributes as many a social media superstar.But Tea is not a Hollywood starlet or catwalk model &#x2013; she&#x2019;s a five-year-old black Afghan hound whose silky coat has made her an internet sensation.Tea had won many awards as a show dog in Australia but found worldwide fame after her recent retirement &#x2013; when a photo of her was shared more than a million times. It shows her sitting on a bench staring into the distance, her extraordinarily long hair splayed out so that it covers the wooden seat.Owner Luke Kavanagh said he was not surprised that Tea had created such a following as she was &#x2018;far too pretty to keep at home&#x2019;. He said: &#x2018;Even our weekend walks draw a crowd. She pretends she doesn&#x2019;t need the attention, but she definitely loves it, just like any supermodel.
