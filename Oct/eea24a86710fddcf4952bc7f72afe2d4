 Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday praised the ocean economy under government’s Operation Phakisa as a successful economic programme. Zuma said the components of maritime, transport and manufacturing were unlocking billions of rand in private and public investments, and creating jobs in the process. “Operation Phakisa is a methodology that helps us to deliver government programmes and projects faster and more efficiently. Major milestones were being attained towards delivering the aims of Operation Phakisa,” Zuma said. “To date, delivery laboratories have been convened focusing on the oceans economy, creating the ideal clinic in the health sector, promoting the use of information communication technologies in the education sector, enhancing growth in the mining sector, as well as advancing growth in the environmental, tourism and agricultural sector.” Zuma said the ocean economy had unlocked about R17 billion in both public sector and private sector investments since the programme’s inception in July 2014. “The economy in the ocean is huge, in many ways,” Zuma said. “With respect to health sector, a total of 114 primary healthcare facilities have been transformed into ideal clinics providing quality healthcare service since implementation in 2015. Our target is that by 2019, a total of 283 primary healthcare facilities should be ideal.” Operation Phakisa is an initiative of the government designed to fast-track the implementation of solutions on critical development issues.
