The late Beatles star -who was murdered in New York in 1980 - will feature in a new graphic novel 'Lennon', which will tell the story of his life; “from childhood to worldwide fame and his solo career and marriage to artist Yoko Ono”. 'Lennon', which was announced at New York Comic Con over the weekend by IDW Publishing, is adapted from the 2010 novel by French author David Foenkinos, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Foenkinos' book told John's life story through a series of imagined sessions between him and a fictional therapist and the black-and-white comic will follow the same format. The book will be released in May 2017. Meanwhile, The Beatles are the focus of a new documentary from Ron Howard, which tells the story of the band's touring years through behind-the-scenes footage, interviews and previously unreleased music. 'The Beatles: Eight Days a Week -The Touring Years' premiered recently in London with the two surviving band members, Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, in attendance but Ron admitted he wishes John and George Harrison, who died in 2001, could have taken part. He told BANG Showbiz: “It would have been a different story with John and George, it would have been even better fleshed out. I really miss the fact, and so do Paul and Ringo, that George and John were not here to participate in it.” However, he added: “Paul and Ringo seem very happy with the project, the way people are responding to it. If it had gone wrong, who wants to be despised by a Beatle? I mean, not me! But I like to think we made a little bit of a connection.” Bang Showbiz
