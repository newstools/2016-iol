Johannesburg - Forty-four years since an inquest found that no one was to blame for Ahmed Timol&#x2019;s death, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has agreed to reopen the case.Exactly 45 years ago on Thursday, Timol - a teacher, member of the SA Communist Party and anti-apartheid activist - died, allegedly at the hands of security police at John Vorster Square in Joburg.Days of alleged torture and threats culminated in an incident where Timol was seemingly thrown from a 10th floor window.The inquest that followed has been described as a farce by Timol&#x2019;s family, with the presiding magistrate ruling the 30-year-old&#x2019;s death a suicide.Despite medical evidence presented of gruesome torture, the magistrate found that the security police had treated Timol compassionately, and no one was responsible for his death.After a private investigation launched by the Timol family and human rights activists, the evidence uncovered was presented to the NPA. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams on Tuesday called for a new inquest into the teacher&#x2019;s death.Abrahams formally requested the minister of justice to approach the judge president of the high court in Joburg to appoint a judge to hear the inquest.Confirming Abrahams&apos;s decision, Dr JP Pretorius of the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit informed the Timol family: &#x201C;We are of the opinion that there is compelling evidence that necessitates the reopening of the inquest in the interest of justice.&#x201D;Responding to the NPA&#x2019;s decision to pursue reopening the inquest, Timol&#x2019;s nephew, Imtiaz Ahmed Cajee, said he hoped the family of Neil Aggett would get similarly good news soon.&#x201C;My grandmother has since passed away, but she will be smiling in heaven today,&#x201D; Cajee said.The Timol family sought the reopening of the inquest in order to have the finding of &#x201C;nobody to blame&#x201D; reversed, he added.Aggett, a medical doctor and trade union organiser, also died while in detention after being arrested by the security police in 1982.
