Johannesburg - As President Jacob Zuma’s legal problems appear to mount, a video showing him dancing the night away in a circle with his wife and other politicians at a state dinner in Kenya on Wednesday went viral. In the video, which starts with Ndihamba Nawe by Mafikizolo, the president can be seen taking centre stage.   The video enraged many South Africans who felt that the president was ignoring local affairs, including the fees protests and the upcoming court appearance of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Some Kenyans also voiced their anger.    The same happened when a picture, which was posted and then deleted on Twitter by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, allegedly showed Zuma’s illegible handwriting. It looked as though Zuma filled in a visitors’ book in which he thanked Kenyatta for inviting him to Kenya and for the warm welcome.  President Jacob Zuma's greeting which he allegedly wrote in a visitors' book on his visit to Kenya. Although it could be confirmed that it was Zuma’s writing, the scribble was shared like wildfire before Kenyatta deleted it. Kenyans again took to Twitter to mock the handwriting.   So this is all #ZumaInKenya could do best.

The handwriting! “ The jibes were in contrast to Mwendandu Kilunguyu’s remarks: “We Kenyans are an interesting lot. The media bash on the South African president is a sign of a badly behaved people. We lack manners and decorum, which are very basic indicators of being civilised. The bashers of the president will, without batting an eyelid, go ahead and apply for a SA visa and wonder what happened when they are mistreated.” Jarusingah Oscar added: “I don’t see anything wrong with President Jacob Zuma’s handwriting. Just like any other politician, either in our country or outside Kenya; we are always mindful of the content than the writing types it entails. The same applies to doctors and lecturers; when you are prominent it doesn’t mean that you are a total man. We all have weaknesses.” Onimi Nimii said: “I think we should focus more on the purpose of the visit than the handwriting.” The Presidency had not commented at the time of publication.  lerato.mbangeni@inl.co.za  The Star
