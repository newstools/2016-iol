Liberating, eye opening and above all fun, road trips are what travelling is all about and there has never been a better time to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. With the ultimate road trip movie, Thelma & Louise, celebrating its 25th anniversary and Route 66 turning 90 this year The Travel Corporation has rounded up the top five American road trips to take in 2016. Forget checking the fuel tank, adjusting to right hand driving or running into any of the criminal activity Thelma and Louise encountered as our expert drivers and guides lead the way.  Trafalgar's Route 66 Nicknamed the nation's 'mother road', Route 66 is the only place to start when it comes to all-American road trips. Not just a highway, this road running from Illinois to California is an icon in itself and this year it will be turning 90. Trafalgar offers a 15 day Route 66 guided holiday where a different aspect of American culture is revealed around every turn as you journey from Chicago to Los Angeles. Highlights along the way include a barbecue contest with a team of master BBQ chefs in St Louis followed by a Be My Guest dinner hot off the grill, the chance to see the amazing Grand Canyon and a visit to the traditional land of the Navajo people.
