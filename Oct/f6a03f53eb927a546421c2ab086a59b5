Gang warfare is brewing in Nkanini, Khayelitsha, after two teenagers allegedly belonging to rival gangs were killed. The father of a suspected gangster was killed and his wife is recovering in hospital after they were shot on Monday. Vuyani Rafisa, 58, was shot in the head and died on the scene. His wife Vuyiswa, 38, is recovering in hospital after she was shot in the shoulder while running for her life. Residents say the gang then headed to two homes, where they killed their alleged enemies. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a group of about 20 unknown males arrived at Rafisa’s home around 1.40am looking for their son. He said the teenager was not present at the time. Van Wyk said a murder and attempted murder case was opened for investigation. A relative, Buyelwa Dola, said the family has since deserted their house for fear of being killed by her nephew’s enemies. She said it was sad that the parents had “to take bullets” meant for their wayward son. “The thugs kicked down the door and demanded that we bring them my nephew. They broke the windows and gained entrance to my sister’s house. Gun shots followed and my sister ran away. “She was shot in that process and a bullet came through the side of her chest. We are praying for her.” Community leader Amos Bango said what is happening in Nkanini is the revival of Vuras and Vatos gang warfare. “This is the sad reality about gangsterism. The innocents are always the first casualties.” He said the community will have a meeting today to discuss what has happened and find solutions.
