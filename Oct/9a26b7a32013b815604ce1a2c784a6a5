Mmabatho, North West - Though the popular Kalahari Desert Speedweek has been officially cancelled for the second consecutive year, speed-chasers can still look forward to the All Tar Speedweek scheduled to be run at the Mahikeng (Mmabatho) Airport on Friday 14 and Saturday 15 October. The second running of the top speed run event will be held in memory of Speedweek organiser Jan Els, who died in September from of a heart attack. The original All Tar Speedweek was held in 2013 at the Upington Airport, but for this instalment will move to the North West province. Mahikeng’s runway is 4.5km long, and top speeds will be professionally recorded at the 3km mark with 1.5km reserved for slow down and runoff. A new format for one-kilometre ‘short bursts’ will also be added for All Tar Speedweek 2016, along with an exciting 3km top end night run dubbed the “Moonshine Run”. Spectators and day visitors are welcome to attend, as the airport has excellent vantage points for everybody to witness the action. There will also be food stalls and entertainment throughout the event. A limited number of camping stands will also be available but priority will be given to event participants and must be booked in advance.
