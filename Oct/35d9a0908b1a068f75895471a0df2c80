He has already had a leadership stint with the Sharks, and now Patrick Lambie will captain the Springboks in Saturday’s clash against the Barbarians in London. Regular Bok skipper Adriaan Strauss will be rested for the non-Test international, and Coetzee has given a first indication of who may succeed the hooker in 2017 following his retirement at the end of the tour. Lambie was part of the Bok leadership at the start of the Test season against Ireland, but his untimely three-month absence due to concussion – after a heavy knock in a challenge by Ireland flank CJ Stander – has meant that the Durban flyhalf hasn’t been able to stamp his authority within the team. But Coetzee feels that the 26-year-old, who has earned 53 Test caps since 2010, is ready to take the next step. “Patrick was always part of the leadership group and part of the spine of the Springbok team,” the coach said on Monday. “He has excelled as a leader at franchise level and has the respect of his peers. He understands the team culture and has a great understanding of the game and the way we want to play. I have no doubt that he will make a success of his appointment as captain for this match. “Adriaan still plays an important role in the squad, by giving support to Patrick and also helping Bongi Mbonambi and Malcolm Marx with technical detail, and he has bought into my succession plan. He understand the bigger picture, and he will be back to lead the team again against England at Twickenham next weekend.” Lambie added: “To play for the Springboks is a big honour and the captaincy comes with a huge amount of responsibility. South Africa has a proud rugby tradition, and the whole squad are excited to represent our country against the Barbarians.”  ashfak.mohamed@inl.co.za  @ashfakmohamed Independent Media
