Honda already has the HR-V and seven-seat BR-V in its compact crossover line-up and now the Japanese carmaker is adding a third in the form of the WR-V. The official sketch you see below gives us our first realistic look at the new contender, but it's worth noting that it won't necessarily be sold around the globe. According to sources abroad, the WR-V has been developed for the Brazilan market and will be revealed for the first time at the upcoming Sao Paulo Motor Show. Does this mean that the WR-V is for South America? It's not known at this stage, although it's worth noting that the Nissan Kicks compact SUV was also developed specifically for Brazil, but it will be offered around the globe, including in SA from 2018. Though no specifics have been confirmed, the WR-V could be based on the Honda Brio's platform, which also underpins the BR-V, although it's evident from the pics that the WR-V will be a smaller vehicle with a sportier design. The most obvious power choice, at this stage, would be Honda's 1.5-litre normally aspirated petrol engine, with most (if not all) versions being front wheel driven. Stay tuned.
