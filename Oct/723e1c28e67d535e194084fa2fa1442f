Doctors attending to SA Football Association technical director, Neil Tovey who suffered a heart attack on Sunday, are pleased with the progress being made by the former Bafana Bafana captain. Mark Tovey, the brother of Neil, detailed the improvement his younger sibling had made. “He is now able to sit on his own, walks unaided and from where I am seated, I must say we are really in good space as opposed to the beginning of this week,” said Tovey. Tovey said there was a lot of rehabilitation to do though before Neil gets to his feet but signs were very encouraging. Tovey had a heart attack on Sunday afternoon while training and was rushed to a hospital where he was placed in an intensive care unit. He has however made great improvement since then and Mark Tovey said he wanted to thank all South Africans for their goodwill gesture and prayers. African News Agency
