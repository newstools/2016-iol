The 19-year-old reality-star took out all the stops to outshine Christina Aguilera from her own 2002 hit music video, ‘Dirrrty!’ Kylie shared a number of photos on Instagram showing off her rocking outfit leaving even the ‘Dirrty’ star to do a shout-out. Christina left a comment on SnapChat saying “YAASSSSS.....Killin it @kyliejenner yes to dirrty 2016!! Get it girrrl!!!” Did Kylie do Christina justice?
