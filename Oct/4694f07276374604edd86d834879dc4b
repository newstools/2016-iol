Durban - A day after Erasmia grandfather Zayne Suliman was murdered while protecting his family at their home, the crime-weary community turned on two robbers targeting another house, killing them.Residents of the suburb, south-west of central Pretoria, had been &#x201C;terrorised&#x201D; by a criminal syndicate since Ramadaan, said crime activist Yusuf Abramjee.He said there had been about 10 incidents recently, but the attack on the Suliman family was the most violent.Suliman was with his family in their Van Der Wall Street home when a robber gained entry, while three others remained in the yard.The 50-year-old businessman is believed to have taken on the robber and was shot.He died in hospital.Abramjee said the home invasion had taken place at about 8.30pm.&#x201C;There is also speculation that the robber was injured.&#x201D;He said a gang was believed to be operating in the area, where there had been a spate of house robberies over the past four months.&#x201C;They have a modus operandi; there are four gunmen, all wear balaclavas and gloves.&#x201C;They arrive in a vehicle, lift their victim&#x2019;s (driveway) gate off the rails and get into their home.&#x201C;In all robberies, only electronic gadgets like televisions and cellphones as well as jewellery and cash are taken.&#x201D;On Friday evening, a day after Suliman&#x2019;s murder, two suspects were conducting a house robbery and fired shots at locals who confronted them when they realised what was happening, Abramjee said.He said both suspects were killed.&#x201C;We believe that it could be a result of people being fed up with crime.&#x201C;But there is no justification to take the law into your own hands.&#x201D;Abramjee said Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane had intervened following Suliman&#x2019;s murder.&#x201C;I felt the police were being lethargic on the investigation, which was worrying.&#x201C;She intervened and there has (also) been increased police visibility.&#x201D;Local councillor Farouk Essop said that crime had definitely increased in Erasmia, with a house robbery taking place every week.&#x201C;It is unacceptable. I had a meeting with the station commander and he said they were going to work towards improving police visibility.&#x201D;He, too, believed that a syndicate was involved.&#x201C;The community is fed up and upset.&#x201D;Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the two incidents were not linked.&#x201C;There was speculation that this (the killing of the robbery suspects) was a revenge attack, which is not the case.&#x201D;Makhubele said it was too early to confirm if there was a crime syndicate operating in the Erasmia area as investigations had not been completed.POST IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
