Washington - The death toll from hurricane Matthew has risen to at least 108, the Haitian Embassy in Washington, DC said in a message on Thursday. "108 deaths have been confirmed, not accounting for certain [inaccessible] areas," the Haitian Embassy said via Twitter. On Wednesday, the Haitian Embassy said five people had been killed and there was significant damage to the country's infrastructure and homes. Hurricane Matthew, the most damaging storm to hit the Caribbean in a decade, is currently moving through the central Bahamas on a path toward Florida's Atlantic coast. The hurricane is the worst natural disaster in Haiti since the country's deadly 2010 earthquake. Xinhua and Sputnik
