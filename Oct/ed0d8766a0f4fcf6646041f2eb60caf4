Johannesburg - Springbok lock stalwart Pieter-Steph du Toit has become the second lock in two seasons to be named South African Rugby Player of the Year. The 24-year-old follows in the footsteps of Lood de Jager who picked up the award last year. Du Toit won the race to the biggest individual award in local rugby; beating off the challenges of second row partner Eben Etzebeth and the trio of Lions players Warren Whiteley, Jaco Kriel and Ruan Combrinck. The Lions though, after their strong showing in Super Rugby - which saw them go all the way to the final and produce a number of Bok players in the 2016 season - were well rewarded with boss Johan Ackermann winning the coach of the year award for the second year running and the Super Rugby side scooping the team of the year award. Also, hooker Malcolm Marx won the award for Young Player of the Year, while Elton Jantjies was named Super Rugby Player of the Year. Rookie centre Jacques Nel was also honoured for his try in the Currie Cup. “Many of the players who won awards this year, will thrill us for many years to come and I’m certainly excited to see what the future holds for them and South African rugby in its entirety,” said acting Saru president Mark Alexander. “It was a challenging year for South African rugby in many respects, but there were still a lot of wonderful achievements worth celebrating and all the players who won awards fully deserve to walk away with the spoils.”  The award winners are (followed by nominees in alphabetical order): SA Rugby Player of the Year: Pieter-Steph du Toit Nominees: Ruan Combrinck, Eben Etzebeth, Jaco Kriel, Warren Whiteley  Young Player of the Year: Malcolm Marx Nominees: Curwin Bosch, Rohan Janse van Rensburg, Seabelo Senatla, RG Snyman  Players’ Player of the Year: Jean-Luc du Preez (Sharks)  Team of the Year: Lions (Super Rugby) Nominees: Springbok Sevens, Free State Cheetahs (Currie Cup Premier Division)  Coach of the Year: Johan Ackermann (Lions, Golden Lions) Nominees: Brent Janse van Rensburg (Boland), Neil Powell (Springbok Sevens)  Junior Springbok Player of the Year: Curwin Bosch Nominees: Manie Libbok, Jeremy Ward  SA Sevens Player of the Year: Seabelo Senatla Nominees: Kyle Brown, Rosko Specman  Super Rugby Player of Year: Elton Jantjies (Lions) Nominees: Ruan Combrinck (Lions), Warren Whiteley (Lions)  Currie Cup Premier Division Player of the Year: Ox Nche (Free State Cheetahs) Nominees: Huw Jones (Western Province), Nico Lee (Free State Cheetahs)  Currie Cup First Division Player of the Year: Masixole Banda (Border) Nominees: Johan Deysel (Leopards), George Whitehead (Griffons)  Supersport Try of the Year: Jacques Nel (Golden Lions v WP, Currie Cup Premier Division) Coca-Cola Craven Week Player of the Year: Damian Willemse (WP)  Referee Award: Rasta Rasivhenge Springbok Women’s Achiever Award: Marithy Pienaar Best Development Programme Award: Blue Bulls Rugby Union @jacq_west  jacques.vdwesthuyzen@inl.co.za  Independent Media
