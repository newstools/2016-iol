Durban - An &#x201C;unscrupulous&#x201D; syndicate may be operating in Durban and Pietermaritzburg, preying on the elderly and conning them of valuable items.Reports have emerged in recent weeks of a &#x201C;friendly and neatly dressed&#x201D; lady pitching up unannounced at the doors of elderly people, convincing them to try a product that would relieve them of their aches and pains.The conwoman would then distract the person, rob them of their valuables and leave.Several elderly women in the Pietermaritzburg and Durban areas have informed police that they were the victims of a &#x201C;friendly and neat&#x201D; woman who wanted to show them miraculous pain-relief products.At least two have spoken out in local media, detailing how they unsuspectingly fell prey to the woman after being duped by false claims of healing products.One lady said the woman, dressed in traditional Eastern clothing, including a shawl, approached her and told her she needed to lie on her stomach to feel how the healing machine worked.The modus operandi used by the alleged conwoman was to use her victim&#x2019;s gold jewellery to activate the healing.The woman would then massage her victim and then make an excuse to leave the house, stating she needed to fetch an item for the healing process from her car.However, after waiting for several minutes, even half an hour, it dawned on the elderly women that the lady was not returning. The women then discovered that their gold jewellery used in the healing was gone, as well as cellphones and money.uMgungundlovu North cluster police spokesman Sergeant Mtokozisi Ngobese said several elderly people had come forward with complaints about the conwoman, who he said was no stranger to police.&#x201C;We know of this woman and we have arrested her previously on small crimes,&#x201D; he said.Ngobese said the woman might be possibly moving between the two cities and committing the crimes, or there could possibly be a syndicate targeting elderly people.&#x201C;We suspect that the person committing these crimes is known to us. We are waiting for one of the victims to positively identify her and then we will be able to release images of her,&#x201D; he said.Femada Shamam, chief operating officer at Tafta, said while no crimes of this nature had been reported at their facilities, the preying on the elderly was a common occurrence.&#x201C;These types of crimes are quite common. The elderly are seen as soft targets that unscrupulous people take advantage of.&#x201C;Our message to people is to not be so trusting of strangers,&#x201D; said Shamam.She said the elderly must take precautions before letting anyone into their homes.&#x201C;Call for a family or friend or someone trusted. If the elderly is interested in the item being sold, ask that person to come at another time when family will be home.&#x201C;If there are people promising lucrative offers, rather err on the side of caution than risk anything happening,&#x201D; said Shamam.
