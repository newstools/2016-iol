Cape Town – The police have received information that the #FeesMustFall movement has been infiltrated by people who have different objectives to the students leading it and are planning to provoke “another Marikana”, acting national police commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane said on Thursday. “We have noted with concern information at our disposal which suggests that the #FeesMustFall initiative has been infiltrated by forces with agendas not aligned with those who seek free education to advance themselves,” he told a media briefing in Pretoria. “The agenda of those with ulterior motives is to provoke the police to the point where there are fatalities attempting to create another Marikana,” he added. Phahlane declined to name those implicated in fomenting violence in the name of the student movement that this week forced university around the country to close. He said the police would deal “accordingly” with any forces found to be seeking to use the protests to provoke bloodshed but would exercise restraint in trying to maintain order when the majority of tertiary institutions reopen on Monday. “The proportional use of force will characterise the work of the police.” According to figures given at the media briefing 327 students have been arrested since February. Phahlane said there would be more arrest soon in connection with acts of arson during student protests. African News Agency
