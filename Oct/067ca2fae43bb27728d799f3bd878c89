Washington - If you're thinking of tying the knot this February 14, the Institute for the Study of Labour in Bonn, Germany, has published new findings that may curb your enthusiasm. People are more likely to get married on Valentine's Day and other numerically special days and are also more likely to get divorced once they've done so, based on data from The Netherlands from 1999 to 2013. Some of that owes to couple characteristics: those who got married on special days were less educated and were less similarly-matched. Even controlling for those factors, divorce odds were higher on special dates. Why? It's not clear, but the authors have theories. Getting hitched on a popular date will make it harder to secure big venues. Low attendance have been shown to increase the chances of a break-up, so that could have something to do with it.  Bloomberg
