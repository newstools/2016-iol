Durban - Firework activities deemed to be in breach of the peace regulations over Diwali and Guy Fawkes will be dealt with. Whether it’s before or after the 10pm end time, Metro police spokesman senior superintendent Sbonelo Mchunu said cases would be dealt with “on merit”. “We are used to it. There is a general rule that fireworks are tolerated until 10pm,” said Mchunu. “We shall deal with cases on merit.” Thousands of Durbanites will celebrate the Hindu festival of lights with fireworks today and tomorrow - and explode more next weekend for Guy Fawkes. But while the occasions are fun for some, they are frightening for animals, domestic and wild - and can fan the flames of intolerance in integrated suburbs. In Westville, the local community policing forum said it hoped the “great amount of community building” would not be undone by intolerance and excessive behaviour. “We always plead for discretion and calm along with mutual respect and tolerance during celebrations of any kind,” said spokesman Caz Weeks. “We ask neighbours to tell each other if a disturbance may be experienced and to moderate any noise levels upsetting people or animals. “While the right to celebrate any religious or cultural feast will be upheld, we plead that fireworks that cause loud explosions are avoided or let off over a limited period.” Robin Candy, chairman of the Greenwood Park CPF, said: “Like all years it will go on well past 10pm. We cannot expect the by-law to be enforced, but we must accept that we are a multi-cultural society. So take the necessary precautions, such as bringing one’s dogs inside.” Urban wildlife is as terrified of fireworks as domestic animals and these creatures have to deal with their fright without the help of caring owners, says Paul Hoyte, director of the Centre for the Rehabilition of Wildlife in Yellowwood Park. “People can stock up on Rescue or other vet-approved sedatives to help pets through this traumatic time,” he said. “For birds, the panic created can cause them to become disorientated and fly into trees and buildings. On the ground, animals running in fear often flee on to roads. Some scavenging animals have also been known to ingest parts of the fireworks, usually resulting in death.” The SPCA Kloof and Durban and Coast branches said they would have inspectors on duty for 24 hours and appealed to people to report strays and incidents of cruelty. Lisa MÃ¶rck of the Kloof branch said the bangs caused animals extreme distress as their hearing was far more acute than that of humans. “Some animals injure themselves jumping through windows, over spiked fences or by running into traffic and being hit by a vehicle.” Independent on Saturday
