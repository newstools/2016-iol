Johannesburg - While metalworkers union Numsa says it supports an international campaign for decent work, it will not join a march being organised by its former federation, Cosatu, on Friday. The union accused Cosatu of having other motives regarding the mass action for decent jobs, which would be held throughout the country. “We shall not… be calling on our members to join the march called by the leadership of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,” Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said on Wednesday, “Numsa believes that this call is a desperate attempt to salvage some credibility by a federation which has abandoned the workers and turned itself into an appendage of the government and ruling party and has become enmeshed in the ANC’s factional battles and driven with divisions.” Read also: Fawu boycotts Cosatu march The campaign comes in the midst of growing casualisation of jobs in South Africa and the rest of the world, the continued use of labour brokers, and attempts to collective bargaining. Jim said Numsa was fully committed to defending workers’ jobs, their living standards and human rights. The union was currently in negotiations in several sectors to get the best possible settlements for its members. It said instead of joining Cosatu, it was joining forces with the students fighting for free higher education and against the “brutal attacks” by police and security companies. It would also continue to campaign against neoliberal policies, in defence of jobs, trade union rights and a living minimum wage. It was working with a growing number of trade unions to launch a new independent and militant worker-controlled union federation. LABOUR BUREAU
