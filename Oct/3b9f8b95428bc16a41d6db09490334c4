The cast and crew of Disney's Queen of Katwe attended the South African Premiere of the film at Montecasino, Johannesburg last night, October 5. In attendance were Lupita Nyong’o (“Harriet”), Robert Katende, Phiona Mutesi, Young Cardamom (performer of #1 Spice/End-credit song), Mira Nair (Director) as well as Akin Osamoto ("Rwabushenyi President”), Rori Motuba (“Christine”) and special guests DJ Sbu, Lira, Simphiwe Dana, Toya Delazy and more. The film, which was shot in Katwe, Kampala and Johannesburg is based on the vibrant true story of a young girl from the streets of Uganda whose world rapidly changes when she is introduced to the game of chess.    The chess-prodigy drama - which is being shown at the London Film Festival - is a family-friendly film made in Africa with an entirely black cast, a first for Disney. "It's very exciting to see a studio telling what is a very African story," says Clare Stewart said. IOL, press release and AP
