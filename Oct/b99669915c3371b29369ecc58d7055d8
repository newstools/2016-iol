Kylie Jenner has shut down rumours she ever hooked up with Scott Disick. The 19-year-old beauty took to her app on Friday October 14 to share a video in which she answers some of the biggest rumours about her that are circulating on the Internet. In one of the questions, the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star is asked if she's ever slept with 33-year-old Scott - the on/off boyfriend of her sister Kourtney Kardashian. Speaking to good friend Anastasia Karanikolaou - who accompanied her in the video posted on thekyliejenner.com - she said: “That's disgusting. Oh my God, don't ever ask me anything like that ever again!” For Scott, the confirmation that Kylie would never hook up with him can only be good news, as he's determined to make his relationship with 37-year-old Kourtney - with whom he shares three children, Mason, six, Penelope, four, and one-year-old Reign - work. A source said previously: “Kourtney and Scott have finally gotten to a place where they can both be completely honest about everything. And it is totally obvious to them now that they are meant to be together, so they just have to do whatever it takes to make it work.” Whilst beauty guru Kylie might not be hooking up with her co-star, she previously admitted the only man in her life was current boyfriend and rapper Tyga. The star has enjoyed an on/off romance with the 'Rack City' hitmaker since 2014, and insists they're happy together and “love each other”. She said: “The first year we started hanging out, everyone around him told him not to be with me. I still get comments like, 'Don't be with him.' But we're not doing it for the public -- we love each other. We need to be together at all times. We never get mad at each other, we just figure things out.” Bang Showbiz
