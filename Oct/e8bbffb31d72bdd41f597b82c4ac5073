Abu Dhabi - Marking their very-own Diwali celebrations at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, 'Festival of Lights' will once again treat the Park's guests to a dazzling line up of entertainment and activities for the whole family to enjoy. Taking place from October28 to - November 5, 2016, under the iconic red roof of the Ferrari-inspired theme park, the festival celebrates the story and the spirit of lights with amazing live performances and acts. This year, for the first time, guests can enjoy an interactive storytelling show that takes them on a journey of discovery of popular tales in Indian culture. As the storytelling puppet elephant captures guest's imagination with his interactive features, the audience is invited to re-enact the legends of the tales by helping to move his trunk, ears, legs and tail. The Bollywood-inspired dancing acts will have the audience spellbound with a blend of traditional and modern Indian dance culminating in an ensemble performance for the grand finale including dancers, Dhol drummers and Indian acrobatics. Other family friendly activities include intricate henna body-art and Rangoli artwork and various competitions and interactive games in which the audience can participate.
