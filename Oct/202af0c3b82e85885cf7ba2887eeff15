PUBLIC PROTECTOR Thuli Madonsela told President Jacob Zuma she will not delay the release of her report into state capture. She reiterated her previous statement yesterday that Zuma had the opportunity from March 22 to answer questions on allegations the Gupta family influenced the appointment of ministers. Ajay Gupta yesterday also hit out at Madonsela, accusing her of flouting the law  governing the Public Protector’s  Office. He said it was evident Madonsela wanted to make adverse findings against them and leave Zuma with a parting shot that cast doubt on his credibility. But Madonsela’s spokesperson, Kgalalelo Masibi, responded that there was nothing further to say on this matter. This followed the request by Zuma on Monday for Madonsela to provide him with her evidence on state capture. He also wanted time to question ministers who had given evidence against him on state capture. Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor accused Zuma of trying to delay the release of the report. She said Zuma was hiding behind state power to circumvent the law. Masibi said Zuma needed to do just one thing: answer the questions sent to him by Madonsela. “Our response is to appeal to him to respond to the questions put to him. "The public protector believes this is in the interest of justice because it is casting a cloud over the government and it should be concluded expeditiously,” she said. Gupta, through his lawyers Van Der Merwe and Associates, said he co-operated with Madonsela’s investigation voluntarily. His lawyers had written to Madonsela warning her that they reserved their rights if she issued her report this week. They said they had not been given an opportunity to respond.
