Liam Gallagher has branded his brother Noel Gallagher a “scary clown” in a new Twitter post. The 44-year-old singer regularly mocks his older sibling and former Oasis bandmate on the social networking website, frequently comparing pictures of the 'If I Had A Gun...' songwriter to a “potato”. But now he's come up with a new comparison for Noel, 49. Liam has uploaded an image of his brother buying milk in his local Waitrose supermarket in Maida Vale, west London, and made a reference to the current killer clown craze which involves people dressing as clowns and jumping out at unwitting people as he ridiculed Noel. He tweeted: “Scary clown buying milk last seen in waitrose Maida Vale call the cops as you were LG x (sic)”  It is not clear if Liam was in the supermarket at the same time as Noel and took the photo himself. The 'Songbird' hitmaker has admitted he has no intention of easing up on the Twitter jibes he aims at Noel and has told Oasis fans to chill out about their feud, which has run since 2009 when the guitarist quit the band. The outspoken rocker said: “Lots of people say I need to chill out about Noel. Not until they stop Twitter. That **** will always get it from me. “I've heard [my tweets] really annoy him. Someone told me the other week that the only thing that does his nut in are my tweets. Good. They will carry on and they will get bigger and better. He slagged me off when we were in the same band! He'd do his interview, I'd come in to do mine and they'd go, 'He doesn't like you, does he?' I'd be saying how great he was. He still has pops. He needs to know that I ain't going away.”  Bang Showbiz
