The 29-year-old reality star recently returned to the spotlight after retreating away when he was suffering with depression, and has admitted he wants to rebuild the relationship with his siblings that he lost whilst he was in hiding. In Sunday's October 16 season finale of his reality show 'Rob & Chyna' - which he shares with his fiancée Blac Chyna - the sock entrepreneur tells his mother Kris Jenner about his idea for a “little family dinner”. Speaking on the show, he said: “Family is important you know just like we're all obviously not always going to be here for who knows how much longer. So I was just thinking we should definitely get like a little family dinner here because I feel like we haven't ... I haven't attended one of those in like years I feel. “I just think it's important so that we all get together. I can text and make phone calls and talk to my sisters or whatever but it's just different when we actually have conversations in person.” The news comes after the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star recently revealed he failed to attend his sister Kim's wedding to Kanye West in 2014 because he was uncomfortable with the way he looked. He said: “I was doing my suit fittings in Paris right before the wedding, and I just wasn't comfortable. I'm 6'1? and at my most I probably weighed 300 lbs. “There were cameras at the airport on our trip there and I was very unhappy with the person I saw in all the pictures. “I'm upset I missed my sister's wedding but it was a personal decision.” Bang Showbiz
