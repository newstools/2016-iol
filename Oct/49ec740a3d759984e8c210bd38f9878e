Cape Town - The ANC on Monday described a call by its youth league leader Collen Maine for the uMkontho weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) to take up arms to defend President Jacob Zuma as reckless.The ruling party was reacting to Maine&#x2019;s comments at a &#x201C;Hands off Zuma&#x201D; march in Durban on Saturday.Maine was quoted as saying: &quot;We are not going to allow anybody to bring Zuma down. There is one president of the ANC and the country and that president is Zuma. Now is the time to defend the revolution. Those guns that are somewhere, you must use them.&#x201D;In a statement, the ANC said this was unacceptable.&#x201C;The ANC views these utterances as unfortunate, irresponsible and reckless,&#x201D; said ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa.&#x201C;The freedom, peace and stability we enjoy in South Africa today came at a price. Amongst those freedoms, is the right to freedom of expression, which does not extend to inflammatory remarks such as those made by the Youth League President and should never be allowed to find space in our democratic society.&#x201D;Kodwa said the party leadership has directed Maine to withdraw his remarks immediately.&#x201C;Current challenges facing South Africa require reasoned, cogent and decisive leadership, not provocative and demagogic talk. Accordingly, the ANC has instructed the ANC Youth League President to retract these comments,&#x201D; he said.Kodwa added that Zuma was the democratically elected president of the country and had the support of the majority of ANC members &#x201C;and society at large&#x201D;.
