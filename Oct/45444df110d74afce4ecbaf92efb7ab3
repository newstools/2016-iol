GPS allows us to locate the exact location of the vehicle,&#x201D; Stoger read from the excel sheet.Stoger went on to the Google Earth application using a projector, which showed the exact locations of Naidoo&#x2019;s vehicle to the court.&#x201C;[There is a] 99.9 percent chance you will find that the customer that says he is at the Shoprite, is in fact there,&#x201D; he said.The system showed that there were times during the time frame that was requested from Car Track by the State, Naidoo was driving at an excessive speed which was over 130km/h which is over the National speed limit of 120km/h.&#x201C;The vehicle was on the N1 western bypass at 134km/h on 30 January at 5:48pm, at 8:15pm he was travelling at 150km/h,&#x201D; Stoger said.The Car Track data sheet later showed that Naidoo was driving at 134km/h on Jan Smuts Avenue,which is an urban main road with a speed limit of 80km/h, at 10:17pm.&#x201C;04:30am on 31 January 2015 the vehicle was travelling at 210km/h on the N1 western,&#x201D; Stoger said.&#x201C;The speed is above the 130km/h threshold.&#x201D;Nandkissor asked Stoger how many trips were recorded as being over the speed limit.&#x201C;There are 37 over the National speed limit,&#x201D; Stoger said.Later Stoger showed the court ,using the projector, where Naidoo&#x2019;s vehicle then halted on William Nicol Drive, which is where he was involved in an accident with Mhere&#x2019;s and another vehicle.Court adjourned till Wednesday.
