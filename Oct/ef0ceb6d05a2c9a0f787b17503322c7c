Tbo Touch is not only making moves in radio but in the winemaking industry as well - and he was swarmed by wine lovers when he arrived at last night‚Äôs Rand Merchant Bank, WineX festival. The annual event has become an institution for wine lovers and wine enthusiasts alike. With over 800 of Mzansi's top winemakers showcasing their best craft under one roof, it's no surprise the show is one of the hottest events in town. The radio personality proudly showcased his product, saying: ‚ÄúTouch Warwick is not only a great wine but also the journey of two families coming together to create good memories and celebrate life achievements." In its 17th year the festival celebrates South Africa's greatest wine cellars and newcomers alike, and Touch Warwick¬†made its grand debut this year. @iamtbotouch is very ecstatic about the #touchwarwick launch #rmbwinex2016 #warwickwineestate @ioltonight @iol_lifestyle A video posted by Kedibone Modise (@kedi_modise) on Oct 26, 2016 at 10:52am PDT Tbo, wine industry leader Mike Ratcliffe Warwick Wine Estate and Vilafont√© have been diligently working towards their maiden vintage launch of Touch Warwick Cabernet Sauvignon since November 2013. ‚ÄúWe created a wine that best echoes social integration, a true footprint of the ideal South African family business,‚Äù said Touch. The collaboration of the Ratcliffe family and Molefe family that have created Touch Warwick Cabernet Sauvignon is embedded in their understanding of the importance of South African heritage and tradition. ‚ÄúGreatness inevitably takes time,‚Äù says Mike Ratcliffe as he describes their long term ambition to have Touch Warwick recognised as a high end, high quality, highly desirable handmade brand. @mikeratcliffe showcasing #touchwarwick #rmbwinex2016 @iamtbotouch #warwickwineestate @ioltonight @iol_lifestyle A video posted by Kedibone Modise (@kedi_modise) on Oct 26, 2016 at 10:05am PDT The first time the world heard about Touch Warwick was in February 2016, when the maiden vintage shattered the charitable Cape Wine Auction records by being the first single bottle of South African wine to be auctioned for  R1.3 million. All proceeds were distributed among selected educational charities groups, early childhood development and youth empowerment. @nambitham congratulations @mikeratcliffe and @iamtbotouch on a great milestone #touchwarwicküç∑üëå #rmbwinex2016 @ioltonight @iol_lifestyle A photo posted by Kedibone Modise (@kedi_modise) on Oct 26, 2016 at 11:10am PDT There were displays of gourment food and biltong but sadly no cheese to go with the wine, chees crackers were the only thing that was in abundance at every stall but that didn‚Äôt seem to bother any of the guests as wine was the order of the day.  ‚Ä¢ The RMB Winex runs from 26 - 28  October¬†at the Sandton Convention Centre.
