Mthatha &#x2013; An alleged robber has died and two others are fighting for their lives in hospital after they robbed students and were apprehended by other students at the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) campus in Mthata in the Eastern Cape, the University said on Sunday.On Friday evening, three robbers gained illegal access to WSU&#x2019;s Phulo residence at the Mthatha campus, university spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo said.&#x201C;The trio terrorised female students and stole electronic equipment from students, including cellphones and laptops. Students duly sounded the alarm bell and fellow students came to their defence. The trio of robbers was found, captured, and beaten by students.&#x201D;While trying to restore order, university security personnel were barred by a mob of students, rendering the security staff unable to perform their duty of restoring order. Security officers then called police and an ambulance.&#x201C;Upon their arrival they were pelted and assaulted with stones and were forced to retreat for their own safety. Public order policing was then called in and the volatile situation forced the police to fire rubber [bullets] to disperse the crowd.&#x201C;Only then was the ambulance able to gain access into the university in order to bring aid to the three would-be robbers who were in poor shape. Regrettably, one of the robbers has been certified dead, while two are fighting for their lives at Bedford Hospital in Mthatha.&#x201C;We deeply regret this incident and condemn the act of vigilantism that has led to the death of a person,&#x201D; Tukwayo said.
