Janet Jackson has officially confirmed her pregnancy. The 50-year-old singer announced six months ago she was postponing her tour to “have a family” with husband husband Wissam Al Mana and has subsequently been spotted with a growing baby bump, but has never commented about the news until now. She told People magazine: “We thank God for our blessing.” It was previously revealed Janet had been suffering from morning sickness but was thrilled to be pregnant. A source said: “Janet is super excited. She's doing great. Janet feels really strong and is just so excited for the baby to come. She feels like this is one of the best things ever to happen to her.” The 'That's the Way Love Goes' hitmaker - the sister of the late Michael Jackson -  has been on bed rest. An insider said recently: “She is doing OK and resting until she is due. “[Janet] is aware of complications, but as of now doctors say she is OK.” And, although she's still a little while off from meeting her baby, Janet  and her spouse, whom she married in 2012, have already started thinking about names for the little one. A source explained: “Her support system is extremely strong. She is taking things easy these days and is feeling well but not overdoing it in any capacity of her life. Janet is staying healthy for her and her baby. “She's been praying for a child for a very long time. She's already in the process of thinking of baby names.” The 'Together Again' singer's older brother Jermaine recently said he thinks she'll be the perfect mother to her child. He said recently: “She'll be a great mother because she is very tough, very strict. But I tell her, 'If you need any parenting skills or baby skills, let me know because I'm the best diaper changer there is on this planet, still to this day.'“ Bang Showbiz
