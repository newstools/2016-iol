By Gertrude Makhafola Johannesburg – Management at Witwatersrand University (Wits) has vowed that academic activities would continue despite violent clashes between protesters and police on Monday. Spokeswoman Shirona Patel said management resolved that classes would continue if it was safe to do so. “Several of Wits’ classes on various campuses are continuing today, albeit with low numbers. Where heads of schools feel it is safe, classes should resume,” the institution said. The university said it had tried to hold a “two-way” imbizo with students facilitated by an independent facilitator, but was threatened by students. “We cannot allow students to violate the rules of the university and bring about an imbizo through threats. This is not democratic behaviour,” she said. Students were refusing to meet with management and indicated that the protests was a national fight to send “strong collective message” of system shutdown to government, said Patel. Running battles between students and the police spilled over onto the streets of Braamfontein as students took their protests outside campus following violent clashes earlier in front of the Great Hall. Protesters blocked traffic and stoned some of the passing vehicles along Jorrissen Street. Police used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse them. Businesses in Braamfontein closed shop ans running battles ensued in the streets. A bus was set alight in Braamfontein CBD . Two students had been arrested and charged with public violence.
