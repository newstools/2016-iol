In their &#x201C;second phase&#x201D; the students may hit a brick wall as they search for a decolonised system of education, writes Vuyisile Msila.Johannesburg - Few will disagree with those who postulate that the current #FeesMustFall issue is the mother of all education struggles in post-apartheid South Africa.So much has happened at higher education institutions since this movement surged last year. Arguably, higher education has never before been such a highly prioritised item on the societal agenda. In the past few weeks we have witnessed the worst scenarios as role-players seek this elusive transformation.It is so paradoxical to see the plunder in institutions of higher learning as students are on the path to search for alternatives of future education.It has been a nightmare as people witnessed art buildings, dormitories, lecture halls and auditoriums all going up in ravenous flames. And, certainly, we cannot build from cold embers or rummage for transformation recipes in rubble.The students&#x2019; anger has been uncontrollable at times and, arguably, along their warpath the cause has lost some sympathisers.It is understandable, some argue, for violence to become a solution, when those in power have deaf ears. However, no one can refute the readiness with which the struggle for free education has grown. The future of higher education continues to hang in the balance as every week leads to twists and turns that are unexpected.How many of us would have thought that, in post-apartheid South Africa, we would see militarised university playgrounds, as students are bludgeoned by zealous security and police?For the past two weeks, gunshots have been commonplace on many campuses, as well as stun grenades that have scattered students in all directions.It will always be a concern that institutions have become shooting ranges. We cannot glamorise violence and sometimes we need to concede that our students do provoke the security forces, although no amount of provocation should lead to high-handedness and military retaliation.Recently, at Wits, we saw a clergyman being shot in the face, and earlier, at Rhodes University, we saw students beaten on the ground. This week we heard how students were on the rampage at Walter Sisulu University.Education has become such a bitter struggle. However, if we think that all will be hunky-dory when the #FeesMustFall protests are over we are only deceiving ourselves.The bigger struggle is still coming, when the &#x201C;second phase&#x201D; is placed on the table - and that is to decolonise education. It is relatively easy to address free education because we can attach quantified items as we peruse budgets.But decolonisation of the curriculum will pose the biggest of threats, for it is an aspect academia has struggled with for decades. It has to do with the changing of mindsets for both students and academic staff.In Africa, we are still struggling to find higher education institutions that teach African philosophies, and campuses on the continent are still looking at the possibility of implementing these.South Africa has taken more than two decades, while in other African states it has been more than four decades. In their &#x201C;second phase&#x201D; the students may hit a brick wall as they search for a decolonised system of education.This is a journey that is as urgent as that of free education. Our institutions need to make commitments and take decisions as to which directions they would take on the path to decolonising their curricula.Many faculties have not yet started this, but by now they should be prepared for various aspects of a decolonised system.In more than a decade we delayed the debates, as, year after year, we appeared to be searching for definitions instead of gearing for practical ways in which to replace colonial education in earnest.Recently, I attended a meeting at an institution to which I was invited by a planning committee on transformation, and found it difficult to agree on simple issues. I wondered how much it would take to overhaul the curriculum.The academics and administrat-ors were discussing a motto that should be adopted. After much bickering, a Tshivenda mantra was found appropriate as it was perceived to reflect the goals of the institution&#x2019;s departments.However, for more than 40 minutes afterwards, the discussion centred around whether the language preferred was apposite given international guests who might not understand indigenous languages.Black academics were at the forefront in this diatribe on indigenous languages.The sadness of African lang-uages is that African campuses can only express themselves in English and other colonial languages spoken across the continent.Our indigenous languages cannot be global; we need the imperial languages to ensure we will be understood.Almost 20 years ago Professor Malegapuru Makgoba stood up as a lone voice at Wits when talking about the African Renaissance at higher education institutions.He tried to take a lead in the debates about a subject that, at the time, was relatively uncharted water in South Africa.There was hope, then, that we would soon be able to find maps that would show directions towards a road that would under-gird the total overhaul and transformation of higher education institutions.Two decades later, we are still where we were, and are still harping on about the same deliberations.We have experienced inertia and found ourselves clamouring for ideals that have led to a dead end.In many cases, institutions end up using rhetoric without really going into the basics of transformation. There is much need to avoid hollow rhetoric when we contemplate transformation, otherwise it will not rise beyond being a convenient fad.Without the fitting tools and the precise maps, transformation attempts will lead to even more confused states.The current transformation needs much courage and zeal from all the role-players, especially from academics who are on the implementation end. Frequently, transformation initiatives simply focus on the present and don&#x2019;t appear to magnify the future.The students have brought us to a crossroad, where more questions arise.There are still various challenges that may stall transformation in our institutions. And this is very true for those who think they have moved.First, some institutions may think they have transformed and may now stop responding to external pressures. This is a major flaw, as change initiatives should be ongoing.Linked to this is the problem of familiarity; because we have been discussing issues time and time again, we may think we have attained our goals. Yet, understanding is one thing and implementation, another.Third, in a diverse society such as South Africa&#x2019;s, the transformation agenda may be interpreted differently by various role-players, hence there is a need to draw a map or a vision where the collective expresses where it wants to see the institution in a few years&#x2019; time.Furthermore, it&#x2019;s the phobia for transformation that frequently divides academic colleagues into various camps which may be determined by race, philosophy, age and political affiliation.Although we have to accede at a higher education institution, the key to transformation is to ensure we package it well, and that it is also the overhaul of scholarship that is critical.Transformation demands relevance and an ability to respond to history, needs, culture and curriculum. While there are many who are critical of the Fallist culture or Fallist movements, one has to acknowledge the gains. On the one hand, critics have highlighted that these movements could not sustain what they set out to do because they were not based upon a lasting vision.On the other hand, though, it is through these movements that many became so aware of the challenges that our society faces. The call for a decolonised curriculum, for example, has been at the centre of the call for a relevant curriculum. This has given the basis for the real reforms in higher education in South Africa.The call for no-fee institutions has also sharpened the debates regarding the various ways in which we can truly achieve models of massification and access.As we haggle over who should pay and who should not in higher education, we should not lose sight of the bigger goal; a goal that explicates and prepares us for the decolonisation of education.The time has arrived for the enhancement of education as it expands through globalisation. It should constantly pose questions on the hegemony and knowledge domination by the West. Msila is the head of Unisa&#x2019;s Institute for African Renaissance Studies.
