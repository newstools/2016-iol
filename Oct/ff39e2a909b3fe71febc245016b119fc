London - South Africa's economy might have already seen the worst of its current economic downturn, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Monday. “We are going through a difficult economic patch at the moment... but we may well have bottomed out,” Gordhan told the FT Africa Summit in London. He said South Africa might see economic growth of one percent, and he hopes to be able to avoid a ratings downgrade. "We predict over one percent next year," Gordhan told reporters, declining to comment on this year's growth expectations.  Asked how worried he was about a possible downgrade by ratings agencies, Gordhan said he would not want to see that happen. "We have put a lot of hard work in to ensure that we present a united national front and also that we communicate a lot better," he said. Fitch and SP Global Ratings both score South Africa at BBB-, the lowest rung on the investment ladder. This means that more conservative funds are able to invest in the country's assets.  Reuters
