Carrie Underwood says each day with her son is “wonderful”. The 33-year-old singer and her husband, Nashville Predators ice hockey player Mike Fisher, welcomed their first child Isaiah into the world in February 2015, and the star is amazed at how he “does something new” which surprises her every single day. Asked whether the highlight of her year would be a professional or personal moment, the 'Before He Cheats' singer said: “There's a lot of intertwining of the two. The ['Storyteller Tour'] has been absolutely amazing, but Isaiah's been there the whole way so it's all colliding. Every day he does something new, every day is wonderful with him.” The 'Jesus, Take The Wheel' hitmaker has previously expressed a wish to expand her family further but has now said she can't put a date on her second child because she's “not in control” of when she'll get pregnant. Speaking to 'Entertainment Tonight' at the CMT Artist of the Year Awards on Wednesday October 19, she said: “My timeline doesn't matter anyway, it's all on God's timing. We just kind of realised we're not in control, and we just take things as they come.” But a second child might not be so practical for the pair, as former 'American Idol' winner Carrie previously revealed she had to put extra effort into working on her marriage to Mike, instead of focusing all their time and energy on their son. She said: “Sometimes you have to make more of an effort to be with each other because it's really easy to put all of your time and energy into your baby. “It's been - not challenging, but just something that we've really just trying to be mindful of and try to make time for each other. We're planning a vacation right now - we need it!” Bang Showbiz
