FORMER Western Province captain Divan Serfontein and SA Rugby Union legend Cassiem Jabaar have reacted with shock to reports that the Western Province Rugby Football Union could be facing a crippling R72 million lawsuit. It was reported yesterday that Aerios (Pty) Limited  will be claiming R72 million  from the WP Rugby over a sponsorship dispute. The dispute is believed to revolve around a sponsorship contract between WP Rugby and DHL (main sponsors of Newlands, Stormers and WP) without the consent of Aerios – holders of the union's commercial rights. WP Rugby president Thelo Wakefield refused to be drawn into the matter yesterday. “No comment. I will not comment until we meet with the board.” Jabaar, a legendary Saru scrumhalf in the 1970s, said: “This was an issue that was raised before in general council meetings, and it’s only surfacing now. "This is a huge administrative problem because they should know what contracts they go into. If they go into any contract, they cannot just do things the way they want to do things. “This issue was raised three years ago and I was a part of that. If Wakefield is now back here with us, he has to answer to what  went wrong.” “I don’t know what’s going to happen if we lose this case. Western Province are  overextending themselves.” Serfontein, who led WP to three successive Currie Cup titles in the 1980s, said: “There needs to be a big shake-up (at WP). "They need to do a forensic audit to find where the problem lies with their finances. The people who aren’t competent need to  be fired. Our rugby is really not managed properly.”
