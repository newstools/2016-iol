Shailene Woodley has spoken out after she was arrested for trespassing on Monday October 10. The 24-year-old actress was arrested when she was protesting against the proposed plans for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which aims to transport crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota and Iowa into Illinois, crossing the Missouri River. The star was among a reported 100 protestors who turned up to the construction site for a peaceful protest, amid concerns that the pipeline project could potentially cause irreversible harm to the drinking water for the Standing Rock community - who live just one mile from the river - as well as the river's ecosystem. Taking to Instagram on Tuesday (11.10.16), the 'Divergent' star continued her fight against the construction, using the hashtags "#NoDAPL" and "#protectcleanwater". She captioned a photo of the river: "one day, baby, we'll sing our poetry. the words dripping from our tongues wet with ripened patience. and the lyrics, the sweet fruits born from the seeds our aging hands are now sowing.#alwaysinallways #heartforward #uptous#NoDAPL #protectcleanwater#iamonyourside (sic)" The news comes after it was reported that 'The Fault in Our Stars' actress had been released from Morton County Jail. A representative for the star told E! News after she was released: "She appreciates the outpouring of support, not only for her, but more importantly, for the continued fight against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline." Shailene was among 26 protestors who were arrested after police broke up their peaceful protest. At the time, the star claimed her arrest was a result of her being "well known". She said: "I'm being arrested! I was down there with everybody else! I don't know what's going on, as soon as they came I left. It's because I'm well known, it's because I have 40,000 people watching." Bang Showbiz
