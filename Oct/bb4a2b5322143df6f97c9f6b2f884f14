Cape Town - Inspired to help those less fortunate, 13-year-old Lisa de Swardt from Blouberg raised enough money to hand out 90 food parcels in Masiphumelele on Sunday.She chose the area near Ocean View after reading about Fish Hoek resident Rosemary Milbank s social activism in the Cape Times.Milbank, a 64-year-old retired tour guide, has for the last year advocated for the residents rights and better living conditions.Lisa said: I know there are many people in our province and country that do not have the basic things. So I began asking my community, family friends for any small donation, so I can do my small part. She said she received R50 donations to package the parcels. We received donations and put together the food packs consisting of a bag of rice, a tin of beef, a tin of vegetables and three packs of soup. After I saw the article about Ma-Rose and how she spoke about the people of Masiphumelele, I wanted to help them in my small way, added Lisa.She also thanked her father, Deon de Swardt, for his help in securing two big donations of R2 000.Deon said he and their family were proud of Lisa. I used my Facebook and hers, and shared her request for donations. This is a very informal small donation and two R1 000 donations from ex-colleagues made up for the bulk of the parcels. Milbank said she hoped Lisa s initiative would inspire others to do similar things. This is such an amazing gesture from this lovely and wonderful girl and her family. I hope this continues and inspires others to help people in or around their own communities that are in need, added Milbank.Milbank said she would be available to help any person or organisation wanting to get involved.The De Swardt family said they planned to continue such projects and maybe one day register as an NGO. dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.zaCape Times
