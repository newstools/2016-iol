Cape Town - Parliament has hit out at Hlaudi Motsoeneng for questioning its process in appointing the SABC board.The chairman of the portfolio committee on communications, Humphrey Maxegwana, said on Friday there was nothing wrong with the process to appoint board members.This week Motsoeneng, who is head of corporate affairs, said the process of the portfolio committee was wrong and it must be scrapped. He said members of the committee appointed people who were serving their political interests.But Maxegwana said this was not true, and said Motsoeneng did not understand the process.&#x201C;We think it&#x2019;s a correct process because we recommend to the president,&#x201D; he said, adding that the president gives his final approval of the board.Maxegwana said if Motsoeneng said the process was wrong, then the president was wrong in approving the board.&#x201C;We are representatives of the people of South Africa in Parliament, we represent the parties and the people of South Africa,&#x201D; he said.Motsoeneng attacked Parliament and ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu. His attack comes a few days before Parliament begins an inquiry into the SABC board&apos;s competence to hold office.Three members will face the inquiry.Former deputy chairwoman Leah Khumalo was the latest member to quit after she resigned a week ago.Maxegwana said the inquiry will be held over three days in Parliament, from November 8-11.Parliament&#x2019;s legal services has interviewed 18 witnesses who will give evidence.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
