Nairobi &#x2013; The Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) has warned the public about the existence of fake exams papers being circulated by conmen.The council said it was aware of the circulation of fake Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) papers and warned parents and pupils not to purchase them as there had been no leak of exam papers this year.The KCPE is an exit national exam for all primary school children in the public education system in Kenya and is set for the first week of November.The fake papers are said to be going for Ksh5000 each (about $50). KNEC chairperson George Magoha said in a statement the council had scrutinised the papers and found all of them to be fake.He warned parents and teachers against buying the fake papers as they would only &#x201C;distract their children from focusing on their preparations&#x201D;.&#x201C;We wish to urge candidates to remain calm as they undertake their final preparations for the examinations,&#x201D; he said.The KCPE will start on Tuesday while the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) will start on November 7. Mahoga said investigations were under way to apprehend the conmen.Meanwhile, the education ministry has asked all teachers to remain away from schools during the exam season from November 1 to 30.The only teachers expected to remain in school were those involved in the administration of practical subjects and boarding facilities. All schools were expected to close by Friday, October 28, to pave the way for the nationwide start of the exams.The directive is contained in a joint press statement issued by three cabinet secretaries, namely education Fred Matiang&#x2019;i, interior and co-ordination of national government Joseph Nkaissery, and information, communications, and technology Joe Mucheru.Matiang&#x2019;i clarified that the only teachers required to remain in schools after October 28 were school heads and their deputies and staff necessary for the exams. This was part of government&#x2019;s strategy for &#x201C;clean and credible examinations in 2016&#x201D;.&#x201C;We are determined to stamp out cases of irregularities associated with the poor management of our national examinations in the past so that the results obtained from the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) are valid and credible,&#x201D; the joint statement said.Mucheru said government had used technology to minimise examinations malpractices which had characterised the 2015 exams.African News Agency (ANA)
