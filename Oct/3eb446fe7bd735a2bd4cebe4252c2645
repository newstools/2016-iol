On Sunday after coming back from church I went to check on her again, but still it was locked.&#x201C;I started panicking and became suspicious. I called her family to report that she was missing.&#x201C;At around 5pm, I went to check her again. I found her boyfriend coming out of her shack; I asked him if he had seen her and he said he last saw her on Saturday afternoon,&#x201D; Dube&#x2019;s friend said.Dube&#x2019;s sister Liziwe said: &#x201C;We received a call from Buyiswa&#x2019;s friend saying that her body was found inside her shack in a pool of blood.&#x201C;I am so hurt because the way my sister died, it&#x2019;s exactly the same way her 24-year-old son died in 2013. We also received a phone call from his neighbours in Site B saying that his body was found in his home.&#x201D; Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
