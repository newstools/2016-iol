Mel Gibson is “too old to get nervous” about having another child. The 60-year-old star is set to welcome his ninth baby into the world soon with his girlfriend of two years, Rosalind Ross, but he insists he has no reservations and joked he doesn't “even react” to the news anymore. He quipped to Extra: “What’s one more? I’m just there to catch. I’m too old to get nervous. I think my adrenals are worn out so I don’t even react anymore.” Both Mel and Rosalind are said to be very happy about their impending arrival. A source said at the time: “Mel and Rose are so excited about the baby. Mel loves being a dad and he and Rose can’t wait to be parents together. The last two years have been some of his happiest years he’s ever had.” Mel has seven children with his ex-wife Robyn Moore - Hannah, 36, Christian and Edward, both 34, William, 31, Louis, 28, Milo, 26, and Thomas, 17 - as well as six-year-old Luna with his former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. Meanwhile, the 'Braveheart' star previously revealed he believes that mothers play a more important role in a child's life than a father does. He said: “Children depend more on the mother. Dad has to be there, but being a mother is tougher.” It was his own fatherhood duties that inspired him to accept the role of John Link, a war veteran who is tasked with saving his teen daughter Lydia Link (Erin Moriarty) from a murderous gang, in 'Blood Father'. He added: “I'm a parent ... it ticked a lot of boxes ... There was something Hopalong Cassidy about it.” And Mel admits to being a little nervous about the movie. He shared: “This film ('Blood Father')? Nervous? Yes and no. One always has a healthy concern that you can do it or that it will work in time allotted with the money. You just have to jump in and act as if everything is going to be great.” Bang Showbiz
