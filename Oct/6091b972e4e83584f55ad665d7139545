By: Jason Woosey Though some manufacturers were notably absent, this year's Mondial L'Automobile still played host to a tantalising array of concept cars and new showroom metal, with a few sensible entrants thrown in for good measure. Batteries vs Petrol The overriding theme this year was battery power and while those such as Renault's Trezor Concept were seemingly designed with the sole purpose of dropping jaws, others such as the Volkswagen ID Concept painted a realistic picture of what will likely drive everyday motorists into this brave new era. Yet given that electric cars are still far from mainstream, petrol-head values were still very high on the agenda and on that note Paris introduced us to some exciting new performance cars, including the Audi RS3 sedan and Honda Civic Type R, the latter shown in prototype form. The current SUV craze in the marketplace was also very well catered for with the likes of Land Rover's new Discovery, Audi's Q5 and Peugeot's 3008, while the upcoming BMW X2 was shown off in concept form. Those on smaller budgets also got some excitement in the form of Nissan's striking new Micra, while Kia's 2017 Rio made a bid to woe hatchback buyers with more conservative tastes.
