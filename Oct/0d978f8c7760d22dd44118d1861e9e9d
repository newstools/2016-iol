The abundance of service plans included in the purchase prices of new vehicles these days means that actual parts prices are not always at the top of consumers minds when kicking tyres on showroom floors. Yet not withstanding the fact that one might end up having to keep the vehicle beyond the plan's expiry period, another factor that can't be ignored is that expensive crash replacement parts can affect insurance costs. The 2016 Kinsey Report, compiled by motoring journalist Malcolm Kinsey, highlights just how expensive it can be to replace what you might have thought of as a relatively simple part. The front door for a Mercedes-Benz GLE or Lexus ES, for instance, can cost you over R18 000. In some instances a single wheel can set you back over R20 000, the survey uncovering prices of R26 904 for an Audi Q7 3.0 TDI's rim and R22 401 for a Volkswagen Touareg V6 TDI's wheel. Modern 'intelligent' headlights can also cost an alarming amount, with Kinsey finding several exceeding R30K: Audi A4 2.0 TDI (R45 486), Audi Q7 3.0 TDI (R43 890), Lexus ES 250 (R36 059) and Mercedes GLE 250 (R33 915). “Accident and crash parts are a valid concern for all vehicle owners and can impact the finances from day one, whatever insurance policies you may have,” Kinsey said. “Aluminium clad vehicles are very expensive to repair and the doors, headlights and rims already mentioned add up to an alarming amount - affecting excess, write off points etc.” Altogether, Kinsey's survey covered 34 common parts needed in servicing, repairs and crashes and his sample included 69 vehicles across multiple segments. Below is a summary of the highlights and lowlights in each category. For more detail, you can download the full report HERE. City Car In the 'City Car' category, the Datsun Go had the cheapest parts basket of the 11 cars sampled, at R43 193.
