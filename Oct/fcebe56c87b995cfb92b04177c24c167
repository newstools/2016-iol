UCT conceded on Tuesday night that student leader Masixole Mlandu’s continued imprisonment had become a stumbling block in negotiations with protesting students. This was stated after a day of running clashes between protesters, private security and police on the campus. Eight students were taken into custody, of whom four were later released after police had confiscated three containers filled with faeces. Chaos ensued after protesters who had entered the main library were confronted by police and security personnel. Mlandu is being held in Pollsmoor Prison after being arrested for breaching his bail conditions – a week after being released on bail. * See the full story in Cape Times and IOL on Wednesday
