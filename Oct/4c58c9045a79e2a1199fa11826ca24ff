Johannesburg - Ugandan police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the beheading two toddlers by their mentally-ill mother, who is from Kamuli District.Uganda&apos;s Daily Monitor reported on Wednesday that Kamuli District police were investigating why a 25-year-old woman allegedly killed her two children, aged 2 and 4.&#x201C;The woman suspected to have mental problems allegedly picked her two children from Bright Future Nursery Primary School in Kamuli on Tuesday only to slaughter them like goats in her father&apos;s house in Mulamba Ward in Kamuli Municipality,&#x201D; reported the Monitor.After killing the children, the woman who has been operating a drug shop in Industrial Area in Kamuli District, reportedly sent a six year old girl to the deceased&apos;s father&apos;s home in Kanange, about five kilometres from the crime scene to inform relatives about her offence before she fled.A police spokesperson, Michael Kasadha, said preliminary investigations indicate the crime was premeditated. At the scene of the crime, both children were found lying on a blanket next to each other covered in blood, their necks having been severed with a knife which was found in a basin.&#x201C;She killed the children, mopped the floor, cleaned the knife, placed the bodies together and had time to change her clothes before taking off. This shows that she took her time with no one noticing,&#x201D; said Kasadha.He added that police were hunting the suspect, but urged angry members of the public not to take the law into their own hands if they found the woman first.Meanwhile, the woman&apos;s father Haji Yasin Kayima Mawalo said his daughter had been receiving psychiatric treatment from Kamuli General Hospital after suffering from hallucinations.
