Cape Town - A British Airways’ travel survey has revealed that Port Elizabethans are the least gullible about London trivia, while Bloemfonteiners are most knowledgeable about sports and leisure. The windy city’s wise residents weren’t duped into thinking that London has the world’s highest rainfall, all Brits take tea at four o’clock every day, buses are red because it’s the Queen’s favourite colour and other whimsical nonsense. On the other hand, many Bloemfonteiners were prepared to believe these and other misconceptions, including that Coco Chanel’s logo is displayed on Westminster lampposts as a romantic gesture and black cabs are free between 12pm and 3pm on Sundays.

Capetonians came a close second in terms of their general knowledge about London, but fared poorly on the sports questions. Durbanites knew the least about sport. The airline commissioned the survey amongst 4 000 travellers in France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and South Africa to gauge how knowledgeable they were about London. Big Ben was the attraction which the overwhelming majority of respondents associated with Britain’s capital.
