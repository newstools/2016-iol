Last week we brought you the view from protesting students, explaining why they can&#x2019;t go back to class without a fight. This week, Masego Panyane speaks to students and parents about how they feel about #FeesMustFall protests right now and what they want to see being done to move beyond the impasse and the crisisStudent*, 2nd year BA Psychology, Wits UniversityI want to learn. I want to be able to listen, be passionate about what I hear, be able to debate with my peers on the way to the next class. But now I am afraid when I hear singing and pass wary policemen with ammunition glinting ... we are watching you.I feel the protesters&#x2019; desperation in their songs, but destroying property, frightening classmates with firecrackers and petrol bombs destroys their credibility. What&#x2019;s the point?I believe that the fight is on the wrong premises. The universities get so much, and thus can only give so much. The problem starts so much earlier than university; it starts from a child&#x2019;s first day at school where teachers are underpaid and uninterested. So the years go by and scraping the 30 percent pass mark is the best the students can do.University is much harder. Students fail, others work hard and pass but even so they can&#x2019;t return the next year, because they can&#x2019;t afford it.But they don&#x2019;t propose feasible solutions. Instead they block roads and surround cars. I was originally writing this in the safety of my own home, now I&#x2019;m finishing on campus.I will have to skirt around a crowd later, flinching at every shout for fear a rock might come hurtling.I will walk past rows of men with shields and bullet belts, an ambulance with flashing lights and students wondering if they should sacrifice their safety to learn.Zakhele Xaba, final year BA Law, Wits University This year #FeesMustFall has been different. It&#x2019;s been radicalised. There are more protesting students but also more students who feel alienated. There has been a lot of intimidation. For me it&#x2019;s psychologically difficult, emotionally draining because I took a stance against some of the violence.It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t believe in what they are fighting for, but I struggled throughout my university years to get funding. I also can&#x2019;t afford to be here. I don&#x2019;t believe in the violence, in intimidation of students. I don&#x2019;t believe in making demands that are unreasonable, like saying you want free education now.Academically it&#x2019;s been tough as well. Our syllabus had to be changed, classes reduced, but that&#x2019;s the minor way I have been affected. I think the country as a whole has been touched by the protest, including the student leaders themselves. They have been affected way more than I have, so I am not going to play victim.I think the only people who hold the key to ending this are student leaders, university management and the state. We need to save the academic year and not disregard the demands made by #FeesMustFall. There is more at play here than just fees. There is pain and bitterness that we all need to work through.Pervania Pillay, 4th year LLB, Wits University My parents did not have the funds to send me to study every year. I have student loans that I&#x2019;ll have to pay back once I qualify. This has fuelled my passion for my academics. I have high regard for my lecturers and the student body; this makes me study past the pain, exhaustion and stress.#FeesMustFall has been driven by a progressive group of students who are not afraid to demand what is needed to elevate the socio-economic status of our country. However there is an issue of methodology. Currently enrolled students, like me, are being silenced in their own fights on the road to graduation by the forcible shutdowns of our universities. The FMF movement claims to speak for the collective of South Africa&#x2019;s youth, yet when we express that we want to go back to class we are labelled &#x201C;sell-outs&#x201D;, &#x201C;fed-up-ists&#x201D; and &#x201C;traitors&#x201D;.The threat of continuing the shutdown is causing me countless sleepless nights. The FMF movement shows little regard for students like me. They claim that they are fighting for the youth, but what about me?Have they asked me if I can financially commit to sacrificing the academic year? Have they asked me why I started the KWO (#KeepWitsOpen) movement? No.I hope that students will mobilise directly to government to demand free education. I hope that the academic programme can continue. I hope that students can stand united without turning this into a race war.Safwaanah Seedat, 1st year BA, Wits UniversityI&#x2019;ve had many experiences during this volatile period. I&#x2019;ve experienced police intervention which included tear gas and firing stun grenades. I&#x2019;ve also experienced situations in which we were told not to attend class or, in other cases, told to leave class.Smoke from police stun grenades and vandalising university property is not a solution to the problem. Fees should fall. University fees are unaffordable for the majority and many students are facing financial pressure.The government has failed to engage and has played no role in recent months. A new funding model must be created urgently to ensure the promise of free education.As a first-year student, my parents have worked extremely hard and have saved up for my university fees. It is for this reason that I cannot afford to lose an academic year.I hope that the government, student representatives and universities can work together and communicate effectively by setting out goals and plans to ensure free education for all.Mother*, 2nd year BA student, Wits University My daughter has worked extremely hard because she wants to get her degree. She tried to work at home when the campus was closed and went back as soon as classes resumed, but she was anxious and frightened.She felt intimidated, she felt as a white girl that she was a target. She and her friends have been harassed, shouted at and sworn at by groups of protesters, calling them &#x201C;bitches&#x201D; or yelling &#x201C;kill the whites&#x201D;.Her classes have been disrupted and at one stage her lecturer was in tears.She has been able to go back this week for some of her lectures, but when she and her classmates arrived at their venue they found it had been petrol-bombed. They went in and the podium and computer had been burnt. It&#x2019;s not very conducive to learning.She has had such acute anxiety about the whole ordeal that she ended up in hospital.She and her friends have tried to form online study groups. Now three weeks of work has been compressed into one, which is hard. They are simply hoping that they will be able to write exams and finish the year.They understand that something must be done about the fees - we also find it difficult - and they felt at the beginning it was right to protest, but the way this institution has been destroyed isn&#x2019;t right.They don&#x2019;t support this violence. They are feeling that their right to education has been taken away, that they are being intimidated, that the SRC that is supposed to be representing ALL students is completely ignoring them and their side of things.My daughter has actually communicated with (vice-chancellor) Adam Habib; he&#x2019;s in an impossible position because it&#x2019;s not his problem. His problem is to keep the institution open and in a good condition. He has no say in funding fees; this is a government problem. They have to do something.The students, I think, have made their point. They have forced the government to look at it. They have forced the government to try and take it seriously. Now this violence, this destruction, this hurt is not necessary.It&#x2019;s becoming a race issue, white and black. It shouldn&#x2019;t be. My daughter feels unwelcome on campus and unsafe. All she wants to do is study.Parent, *prospective 1st year student in 2017My main concern as the parent of a matriculant is seeing that she gets good grades. She applied at three South African universities, including the University of Cape Town. But I have my reservations because that&#x2019;s so far away.If things don&#x2019;t go back to normal, many students won&#x2019;t be able to pass and my daughter and others like her won&#x2019;t have space in the system.All I can do now is make sure that my daughter passes with good marks. Names withheld for fear of intimidation. Saturday Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
