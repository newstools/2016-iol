Beirut - The Lebanese parliament on Monday elected former army general Michel Aoun as president, a move that ends a 29-month power vacuum but does little to mend the country&apos;s deep political divisions, analysts say.Aoun is an ally of the Iran-backed Hezbollah Shi&#x2019;a movement, an organisation that wields significant influence in Lebanon and supports the government of Bashar al-Assad in neighbouring Syria.He received 83 votes out of the 127 deputies present at the second round of voting, during which a simple majority was required.By nightfall, Aoun&apos;s followers were holding celebrations across the country.Supporters filled Martyrs&apos; Square in central Beirut, where a huge celebration was to be held. Cars with Aoun&apos;s image roamed the streets of the capital while passengers chanted &#x201C;Lebanon will now be safe.&#x201D;&#x201C;National unity is the basis of the stability and security of the country,&#x201D; Aoun said at an earlier parliamentary session where he was sworn into office, becoming Lebanon&apos;s 13th president since the country gained independence from France in 1943.In his speech, Aoun also addressed security, the economy and his plan to return more than 1 million refugees who have fled to Lebanon from war-ravaged Syria.&#x201C;There will be no solution in Syria without the return of the refugees,&#x201D; Aoun said, also urging the Lebanese army to be strengthened in order to confront any threats to the country.Schools and universities were ordered closed on Monday, as the army imposed tight security measures across Lebanon.Aoun moved to the presidential in Baabda, north-east of Beirut, where he will reside during his six-year term.Streets across the capital Beirut were filled with posters of Aoun and the orange flags of his political Party, The Free Patriotic Movement.&#x201C;Aoun is not only a Christian leader, but also a leader of all Lebanese people,&#x201D; one of his followers said.Aoun&apos;s election was made possible after former premier Saad Hariri, who is backed by Saudi Arabia and also has the largest bloc in parliament, announced its support for his nomination. In return, Hariri is likely to become prime minister.Walid Jumblatt, a leader of the Druze religious minority, said after the election that &#x201C;all Lebanese politicians should work to turn over a new page for the country.&#x201D;The Lebanese presidency is usually held by a Maronite Christian in the country&apos;s sectarian power-sharing arrangement while the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shi&#x2019;a Muslim. The presidential post has been vacant since former president Michel Suleiman&apos;s term ended in May 2014.Lebanon&apos;s parliamentary speaker, Nabil Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah, has openly opposed Aoun&apos;s candidacy for presidency, but has said that he will not boycott the session.According to analyst Amin Amoriyeh, Aoun&apos;s election puts an end to the political stagnation but warns sectarian divides remain firmly entrenched.&#x201C;Having a new president in the presidential palace will not solve all the political problems in the country. The remaining will be to have a premier and form a new government without delays and obstacles,&#x201D; Amoriyeh said.Hezbollah, which nominated and backed Aoun, has been fighting alongside President al-Assad against rebels seeking to oust him since 2011.The election of Aoun is seen by many observers as a victory for Hezbollah over the Saudi and Western backed coalition in the country.An army commander during Lebanon&apos;s 1975-90 civil war, Aoun is known to have aspired to the presidential post. He is the fourth Lebanese president from a military background.Aoun was one of the first Lebanese voices to rise against the Syrian military presence in Lebanon during the 1990s. He had to live in self-imposed exile in Paris until 2005 when Syria pulled out following the assassination of former premier Rafik Hariri.He returned to Lebanon, but fell out with his former allies, the anti-Syrian Western-backed coalition, and struck up an alliance with the pro-Syrian Iranian Hezbollah movement.&#x201C;Congratulations to General Aoun, the Lebanese people and all parties in the country,&#x201D; Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said in a statement carried by Fars news agency.SAPA-dpa IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
