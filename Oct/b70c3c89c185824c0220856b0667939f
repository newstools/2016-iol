The DC Comics superhero will be inducted as an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls by the United Nations at her 75th birthday party in New York on October 21 at the organisation's headquarters. Wonder Woman was created in 1971 by William Moulton Marston, whose character comes from the all-female fictional paradise of Themyscira in the Amazon. Though she was initially written to test the reaction of fans to a female superhero in the DC comics universe, her popularity grew quickly and she got her own storyline just one year later. Actress Lynda Carter donned her familiar red and blue bodysuit and armour in the 1970s hit TV series 'Wonder Woman' and Gal Gadot debuted her version of the sword-wielding warrior in 'Batman V Superman' earlier this year, with a standalone movie due to be released next year. Last month, Wonder Woman writer Greg Rucka revealed the character is, in fact, bisexual and has had relationships with other women. Asked was the character gay, he told Comicosity: "Yes. I think it's more complicated though ... when you start to think about giving the concept of Themyscira its due, the answer is, 'How can they not all be in same-sex relationships?' Right? It makes no logical sense otherwise. It's supposed to be paradise. You're supposed to be able to live happily. You're supposed to be able ... to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women. "But an Amazon doesn't look at another Amazon and say: 'You're gay.' They don't. The concept doesn't exist." Meanwhile, the US Postal Service is set to mark Wonder Woman's 75th birthday and release four Wonder Woman stamps. Bang Showbiz
