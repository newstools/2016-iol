Brad Pitt will not file a legal response to Angelina Jolie's divorce petition. The 52-year-old actor was expected to file his own legal papers following the 42-year-old actress' divorce petition in which she requested to be granted full physical custody of their six children; Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne - on Wednesday (19.10.16), but the deadline came and went without him or his legal representatives filing. Brad reportedly refused to send off the paperwork because he believes a potentially nasty legal battle could cause psychological damage to their children. A source close to the 'Fury' actor told website TMZ: "Brad wants joint legal and physical custody, but if he actually filed papers it would draw the battle lines. Angelina wants sole physical custody, setting up a possible custody war."  The 'Maleficent' star has the opportunity to start petitioning for a default judgement, but the publication has reported she won't let that happen, as she agrees that healing the family is the priority.   Meanwhile, the 'Fight Club' star is still being investigated by the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services for an alleged altercation with his eldest child Maddox on a private jet. Angelina and her children were reportedly interviewed by two FBI agents about what happened on the jet, though 'Entertainment Tonight' reported it was not part of a formal investigation and the officials are still in the "fact-finding" stages. Earlier this month, it was reported the FBI would not be opening an investigation into the alleged confrontation because "Maddox suffered no injuries and some witnesses on the jet say Brad's contact with the boy was inadvertent."
