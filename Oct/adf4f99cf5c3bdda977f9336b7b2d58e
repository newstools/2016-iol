Johannesburg - An SABC van was set alight on Friday night as police tried to calm the chaos allegedly caused by student protesters in Braamfontein. At least four other fires were started on the Wits campus earlier in the evening but were quickly extinguished. Protesters made the Braamfontein area a no-go zone by throwing stones at passing cars and destroying property. Residence students were told to stay indoors while medics, anticipating injuries, had reportedly taken up posts inside the Holy Trinity Catholic Church that flanks the university on Jan Smuts Avenue. Students at public universities have been protesting for weeks demanding free higher education under #FeesMustFall campaign. The protests have been marred by destruction of university properties as running battles between students and police continued. On Friday night those supporting the call for free university education were posting Tweets under the hashtag #Habibsapartheid saying “The revolution never sleeps” and “Before Habib sent police to terrorise black students, there was never violence, just peaceful protests”. According to ﻿some tweets Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib ﻿imposed a 10pm curfew on Friday night.   We are told that if you're on campus after 10pm you will be arrested. Stay safe comrades. The system is against you 😭 #HabibsApartheid  — Wits SRC (@WitsSRC) October 14, 2016  There were also reports of clashes with police at Wits residences.    The Saturday Star
