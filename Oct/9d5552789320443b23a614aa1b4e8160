Tbo Touch and Lerato Kganyagos 's social media argument seems to have simmered down as Touch retweeted Lerato's tweet that said, “Touch has BEEN & STILL is  my brother AND my friend!! I don't need social media to communicate with him...??(sic) Lerato was responding to a tweet  by The Creativ Tshediso who asked: Whats your take on what Tbo Touch tweeted to you? This is the kinda question you always ask people on your radio show right? It all started off when someone tagged Lerato in a tweet saying that Touch's listeners had left the show after he resigned from Metro FM. To which the Metro FM host replied saying that audience figures had actually doubled since she and Moflava took over the afternoon drive show. The issue became a mini “twar” when Tbo Touch replied with a “”how dare you?” tweet, further daring Lerato to show him stats that prove her statement. He also said that he would quit radio and transfer a million into Lerato’s account is she could back up her statement. Lerato fired back saying, “You owe me money for gigs but you tell me about millions”.   It seems like its all water under the bridge now.   IOL
