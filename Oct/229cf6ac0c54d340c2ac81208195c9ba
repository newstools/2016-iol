Cape Town - Hashim Amla has been reinstated as the Proteas opener alongside Quinton de Kock, while Rilee Rossouw will bat at No 4 in Wednesday’s third ODI against Australia at Kingsmead. Amla was controversially left out of the team in Sunday’s second clash after returning from a bout of flu, with Rossouw continuing at the top of the order. But the Proteas selectors have brought back the stalwart bearded right-hander, with Rossouw moving down the order. The casualty is Farhaan Behardien, who could feel somewhat unlucky after scoring a 50 off 22 balls against Ireland, while David Miller hasn’t gone past 26 in his three ODI innings this season. JP Duminy will shift to No 5. In the only enforced change, Wayne Parnell is battling with a rib issue and is not fit to play, which sees Dwaine Pretorius come in for his second ODI after making his debut against Ireland. Australian captain Steve Smith won the toss and chose to bat first, and said that he hopes his team could place the Proteas under pressure by getting runs on the board. The Aussies need to make the play as they are 2-0 down in the five-match series. The visitors have made one change to their line-up, with Daniel Worrall replacing Joe Mennie in the fast-bowling department. Proteas skipper Faf du Plessis said that he would also have opted to bat first as it could be tricky to bat at night under the lights and extra swing, but he hoped that his bowlers can make good use of the pitch first as there has been a lot of rain falling in Durban this week.
