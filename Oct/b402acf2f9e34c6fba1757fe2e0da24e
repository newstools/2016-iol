Caledon &#x2013; A South African Police Service (SAPS) constable stationed at Caledon was so shocked when he was arrested for blackmailing a dentist in a nearby town that he had to be hospitalised, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in the Western Cape said on Saturday.The 38-year-old police constable and his 15-year-old niece were arrested by members of the Hawks anti-corruption unit in a sting operation on Thursday for alleged corruption amounting to R50 000, Captain Lloyd Ramovha said.The off-duty constable allegedly approached a dentist from Grabouw purporting to be investigating instances of apparent false claims allegedly submitted to his medical aid by the dentist. &#x201C;He then demanded the money, blackmailing the dentist in the process,&#x201D; Captain Lloyd Ramovha said.&#x201C;The Hawks were alerted and an undercover operation was carried out, leading to the swift arrest of the police officer and his niece outside the dentist&#x2019;s premises after the money was paid to him by the doctor. The cash was recovered from the handbag in the teenager&#x2019;s possession.&#x201C;Following the arrest, a visibly shocked constable had to be treated for apparent heart attack-like symptoms at a local hospital under police guard. The minor was released under her parents&#x2019; care.&#x201D;They were expected to appear in the Grabouw Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Monday on corruption-related charges, Ramovha said.
