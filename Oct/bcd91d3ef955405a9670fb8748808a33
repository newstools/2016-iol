Parliament &#x2013; President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s question-and-answer session in the National Council of Provinces got off to another rocky start on Tuesday when MPs from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) tried unsuccessfully to block him from speaking in the House.Several EFF MPs were physically removed by after objecting to Zuma answering questions.&#x201C;You must not allow Mr Zuma, the president of the ANC, to address this august House, bearing in mind that Mr Zuma has violated his oath of office as president of the country,&#x201D; said Tebogo Mokwele, before being ruled out of order by NCOP chairwoman Thandi Modise.Mokwele was dragged from the House after Modise ruled: &#x201C;You have made the appeal. We are rejecting the appeal.&#x201D;The rest of the EFF MPs were also eventually booted after raising similar concerns to Zuma&#x2019;s presence in the NCOP.
