Jerusalem - Israel has charged 13 people in connection with a video from a Jewish wedding party showing a frenzied crowd brandishing military-issued rifles and stabbing a photo of a Palestinian toddler killed in an arson attack.The 13, five of them minors, were charged Wednesday with incitement to violence or terror, among other offenses.The video, which surfaced last year, shows a rowdy group of skullcap-wearing youths hoisting rifles and a firebomb and dancing to music with lyrics calling for revenge. Some revellers appeared to be stabbing photos of 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh, who died when suspected Jewish extremists firebombed his family home in the West Bank.The video sparked outrage and ratcheted up criticism that authorities have been too lenient toward rogue Israelis for too long.AP IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
