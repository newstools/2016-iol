The 41-year-old comedian has dismissed claims her best friend found it funny when her ex-husband - who began dating his 'Mrs and Mrs Smith' co-star shortly after they split in 2005 - and his wife had separated, insisting the 'Cake' actress finds it “ridiculous” that she is still talked about in the same breath as the 'By the Sea' stars. Chelsea said: “It's so stupid and pathetic. As if Jen cares - she doesn't care. “It's ridiculous that people still drag her into this. Hello! As if she's sitting around even caring about this.” After the news broke of Brad and Angelina's split last month, Chelsea branded the actress a “f***ing lunatic” and questioned why the 'Moneyball' star - whose drinking and partying was said to have been a factor in the break-up - would need to “self-medicate”. The 'Chelsea Does...' host can't understand why her comments attracted so much attention but admitted she thinks she was only voicing other people's thoughts. She said: “I made one comment on my show that got completely blown out of all proportion. I'm being quoted as if I live with them. “[Was I being harsh?] No. I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking.” Earlier this year, Jennifer - who is married to Justin Theroux - penned a piece for The Huffington Post in which she slammed constant speculation about whether she will have children, and Chelsea was thrilled she spoke out about the “nonsense”. She told Britain's Grazia magazine: “It was just so nice for her to finally respond to it. “It doesn't matter how famous or rich or wealthy you are, you're still able to get your feelings hurt. “That is a person, that's a human being that is constantly being scrutinised. “I hope it helped people see the pain that it is causing with the presumption and the obsessions and the nonsense.” Bang Showbiz
