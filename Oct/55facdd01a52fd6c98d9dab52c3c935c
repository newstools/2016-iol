Johannesburg - The national minimum wage and other labour relations matters before the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) will be finalised by the end of November. This is according to Nedlac social partners and deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa following a report back meeting this past weekend. The committee received a progress report from the panel of experts appointed two months ago to set the national minimum wage level, among other recommendations. “Substantial progress is being made by NEDLAC social partners in the negotiations on Labour Relations with particular reference to labour market stability and the national minimum wage process on which the Panel on National Minimum wage is scheduled to table a report to the Committee of Principals by the end of November 2016. The social partners unanimously confirmed their belief that inclusive negotiations are the best way to solve problems,” Ramaphosa said in a statement on Monday. Cosatu had issued a statement prior to the meeting urging government and business to move speedily to conclude the two year old negotiations. However the deputy president said the social partners had all acknowledged the need to work urgently to conclude the work. @ThetoThakane Labour Bureau
