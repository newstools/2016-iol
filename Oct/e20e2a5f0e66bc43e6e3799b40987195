Johannesburg - South Sudan&apos;s controversially ousted opposition leader, Dr Riek Machar, who fled the world&apos;s newest country after fighting broke out in July, is currently in South Africa receiving medical treatment.However, he won&apos;t be welcome home anytime soon.The Sudan Tribune reported on Sunday that President Salva Kiir was working with foreign powers to find a country that will grant Machar asylum as long as he stays out of politics.Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan&apos;s Information Minister, said the government had placed a political ban on Machar, following his call for armed resistance against Kiir.&quot;He is being exiled. He will not be coming back to South Sudan and he will never be allowed to talk politics again,&quot; Lueth told reporters.Lueth&apos;s comments followed Kiir asserting that Machar would only be allowed to return if he denounced violence and came back to the country as a normal citizen without official assignment.Kiir said that he had developed a good working relationship with Machar&apos;s controversial replacement, Taban Deng, who was appointed after the opposition leader fled South Sudan saying his life was in danger, following July&apos;s clashes between Machar&apos;s Sudanese People&apos;s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO) and government forces.Machar has since declared war on South Sudan, despite the August 2015 peace agreement, in an alleged bid to topple Kiir&apos;s government, a move condemned by the international community.During an interview with the African News Agency South Sudan&apos;s Ambassador to South Africa, Philip Jada Natana, accused Machar of attempting a coup and failing to take responsibility for his part in the civil war.&quot;This has always been Machar&apos;s tactic - to capitalise on popular sentiment when international criticism is levelled against Juba and then present that as his bargaining chip,&quot; Natana told ANA.&quot;This was his strategy even during the war in 2013 when there was strong criticism, particularly from the Americans, against corruption by the government. Machar used that as a whipping post to further his own agenda,&quot; said Natana.&quot;He also tried once again to overthrow Sudan&apos;s legitimate government in July just as he tried in 2013.&quot; African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
