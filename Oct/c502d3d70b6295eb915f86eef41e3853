Cape Town - Warriors acting selection convenor Lux Qoboshiyana will replace Ashwell Prince on the Proteas panel, after Prince resigned to join the Cape Cobras as an assistant coach recently. Cricket South Africa announced on Monday that Qoboshiyana, who has also been a selector and convenor for the Border Cricket Board in the past, had represented the province under the SA Cricket Board prior to unity. Qoboshiyana will be part of the Proteas selection panel that includes Linda Zondi as the convenor, Hussein Manack, Errol Stewart and coach Russell Domingo. "On behalf of the cricket family I extend congratulations and good wishes to Lux on his appointment,” CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. “He takes on an important job and has the necessary experience to be a worthy selector after having served both at provincial and franchise levels. He can also draw on his experience as a former player." Prince served as a national selector from June 2015 and was appointed for a two-year term, but is determined to make a contribution to South African cricket as a coach going forward, and joined the Cobras as an assistant to Paul Adams last month. Qoboshiyana's first task as a Proteas selector will be to help pick the team for the opening Test against Australia in Perth, which starts on November 3. The big conundrum facing the selectors will be whether to opt for an all-pace attack of Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada and probably Kyle Abbott, or add left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi into the mix at the Waca.  ashfak.mohamed@inl.co.za  @ashfakmohamed Independent Media
