Indian-born actress Priyanka Chopra has nine passports. The Baywatch star flies around the world so much that she has amassed a hefty number of travel documents. She said: “Yes, flying is my favourite time. I use it to sleep, especially on the 16-hour Mumbai to Los Angeles flight. You can sleep eight hours and still have eight hours when you wake up. I read scripts and decide what films I’m going to do. And I usually land and head straight to work. “For example, when I was finishing work on Bajirao Mastani, I also was taping for Quantico. Even Baywatch I shot on the weekends of Quantico. I have nine passports! I’m on at least six flights a month.” And the 34-year-old actress admits she is a bit of a “nomad” and hasn't decided where she'd like to settle down. She told Condé Nast Traveller magazine: “I’m more of a West Coast kind of girl. I like the chill of Los Angeles. But I’m a nomad. “And look at the world we live in today, we can literally get on a plane, go somewhere for five hours, have lunch, and come back. Why do you have to commit? I have commitment issues anyway.” With all the flying between countries, it is no surprise that Priyanka hasn't really had time to date. She said: “I’ve never dated.  I’ve always been in relationships.  It’s very different.  You like someone, you court each other, you get into a relationship. “You’re answerable to each other.  Whereas the nonanswerability of dating, my god, I don’t know if I would ever be able to. I’ve never done it, so I don’t know.” Bang Showbiz
