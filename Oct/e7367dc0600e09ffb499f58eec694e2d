By: IOL Motoring Staff Bad Neuenahr, Germany - It is unlikely that you'll find any M2 fans out there that have not fantasised about a GTS version of the M Division's smallest member. Since BMW hasn't developed one, German tuner Alpha-N felt a duty to step up to the plate and create the next best thing. The tuner describes its new beast as having the style and spirit of a GTS, but in an affordable and attainable package. But there's more to this conversion than just style. Alpha-N has tinkered with the software of BMW's 3-litre, six-cylinder TwinPower turbo motor to liberate 331kW, a decent hike on the standard M2's 272kW. To put that all into perspective within the M4 family, the standard coupè pushes 317kW and the M4 GTS is good for 368kW. The tuner has not released any torque figures or performance numbers, but is already promising that a more powerful tuning package will be available by the end of this year. Buyers wanting to take the M2's road holding and braking abilities to the next level can also opt for an Öhlins Road & Track fully-adjustable coilover suspension system and a ceramic braking system from the M4. The styling kit is also available separately and buyers can pick and choose which bits they want, form a GTS-style bonnet (in carbon fibre or Kevlar) to a front spoiler, carbon-fibre roof panel, splitter and underbody diffuser.
