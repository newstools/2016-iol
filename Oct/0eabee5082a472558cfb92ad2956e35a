Durban - A Durban-based logistics company has been granted an interdict against a former manager who had allegedly been stealing clients for a competitor he was now working for.He had apparently quit the company citing family difficulties and that he intended leaving this field of work to relocate.Durban High Court Judge Esther Steyn on Friday granted an order restraining the former employee from being involved in anything seen as being in competition with the business conducted by Avcres Transport, for six months.He was also prevented from using any information about Avcres&#x2019; functions, transactions, business or affairs to his benefit and which may cause injury or loss to the company.He cannot solicit work from any of the company&#x2019;s existing clients for a period of a year.Avcres&#x2019; competitor agreed to fire the former employee and not use his services for a year.Avcres filed an urgent application before the high court because the competitor had apparently ignored all their correspondence.The company also feared it may have to retrench its staff, or worse, shut down, because the former operations manager allegedly stole its clients, ignoring a restraint of trade agreement.Avcres member, Aveshen Naidoo, said the former operations manager was employed in January and closely liaised with their clients.In mid-September the manager resigned citing family difficulties and said he intended relocating to Gauteng. However, Naidoo said he learnt the former manager took up a similar position at their competitor in October.Naidoo argued this was a breach of a restraint of trade which stated that the former manager could not be employed by a competitor for 36 months after termination of his employment.Naidoo said they would accept a period of restraint for 12 months instead.He also said he was alerted about the alleged poaching of clients when several alerted him the former manager had contacted them on behalf of the new company, trying to solicit their business.
