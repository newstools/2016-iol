Johannesburg -  Old Mutual on Monday announced that Ralph Mupita had resigned as chief executive of Old Mutual Emerging Markets (OMEM). This, it said, is to pursue interests outside of the financial services industry. Old Mutual said Mupita's resignation would not affect the business readiness programme OMEM was undergoing, like the rest of the Old Mutual businesses, as part of the business's managed separation process. The search for a successor to Mupita, who had a notice period of three months, would be launched immediately. Bruce Hemphil, Old Mutual chief executive and chairman of OMEM, thanked Mupita for his dedicated leadership over five years at the helm.
