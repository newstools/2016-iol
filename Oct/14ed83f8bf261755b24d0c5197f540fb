Sharks winger S’Bura Sithole emerged largely unscathed after his car flipped in a single vehicle accident on Durban’s Masabalala Yengwa (NMR) Avenue early on Thursday. The sponsored Audi S3 looked to be a write off. RescueCare spokesman, Garrith Jamieson, said paramedics had attended the scene. Sharks spokesman, Novashni Chetty, confirmed that Sithole had been driving, but was not badly injured. The incident was believed to have happened at about 5am.Chetty said the Sharks were relieved the winger had escaped without serious harm. Sithole, one of eight uncapped players called up to a Springbok training camp before the 2014 mid-year rugby union Tests, is also something of a rap musician. He featured on a track, Chocolate, with Durban rapper Novi Naidoo. Daily News
