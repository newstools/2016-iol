Shocking video footage of Durban pupils are making waves on Facebook. The explicit video shows pupils from Werda School in Hillary, Durban in a confrontation. The uniformed victim in the video is seen walking with other school mates when he is approached by the bully, who hurls insults and beats him up for being a “snitch.” The victim is heard saying “Let me go. I don't want any trouble.” The video has since gone viral on Facebook and has received close to 50 comments.   In a statement released on their Facebook page the Werda School said they have a zero tolerance policy towards bullying. “It is with this mind that we have already initiated an internal disciplinary process against the alleged offenders... The alleged offenders have been temporally suspended from school.” “The victim is being counselled...and his family has been advised to open a case at the SAPS.” IOL MOJO
