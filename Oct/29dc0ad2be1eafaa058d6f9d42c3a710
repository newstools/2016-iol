Pretoria - Despite withdrawing the fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Services (Sars) senior officials, National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams must &#x201C;fall&#x201D;, Democratic Alliance Leader, Mmusi Maimane, said.Addressing hundreds of supporters in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria, on Monday, Maimane said Abrahams&#x2019; withdrawal of the charges did not make him a hero.&#x201C;He is the national director of public prosecutions who was elected to that post by tsotsi (gangster) number one, the accused number one, [President] Jacob Zuma. He was brought to fight Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s battles. That is why they are fighting the minister of finance [Gordhan].&#x201C;As we are gathered here, Shaun Abrahams has just announced that all the charges against Pravin Gordhan have been withdrawn. He thinks we will give him a hero&#x2019;s welcome. He is being used by a tsotsi. How can you drop charges that never existed in the first place?&#x201D;Maimane stressed that despite that gesture of withdrawing the charges before the matter is heard in court, Abrahams must now be removed from the NPA.&#x201C;We&#x2019;re here to say Shaun Abrahams must resign. He must fall and go away. He works for Jacob Zuma. He thinks public prosecution stands for president&#x2019;s protection. There is nothing like that. Shaun must go,&#x201D; said Maimane.The opposition leader urged the DA supporters to join protest marches set for Pretoria central on Wednesday.&#x201C;We&#x2019;re still marching, because we were never marching for Pravin Gordhan. We were marching for the Constitution. We are marching for the freedoms of South Africa. We are going ahead and march on Wednesday. I would like to see you there when we stand together saying the Constitution first and Jacob Zuma last,&#x201D; said Maimane.He said Zuma&#x2019;s legal woes were costing South African taxpayers dearly.&#x201C;Why are we protecting a criminal number one? That is why we are going to meet him in court. We will deal with in court on Tuesday and Wednesday.&#x201D;In a statement issued by the DA, the party said Maimane will be present in the High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday as Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and Zuma seek an interdict to prevent the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s report on state capture.On Wednesday, several opposition political parties and civic society groups are planning to march in Pretoria &#x2013; on the day when Gordhan, and the former Sars officials were scheduled to appear in court for fraud charges. Abrahams announced the withdrawal of the charges earlier on Monday but protests are still lined up.Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said the DA and Economic Freedom Fighters were set to march to the Pretoria Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Wednesday. The marches have been approved.&#x201C;All marches will commence from 08h00 until 15h00. The DA and Economic Freedom Fighters will march from Church Square [in the city centre] to the Pretoria Magistrate Court.
