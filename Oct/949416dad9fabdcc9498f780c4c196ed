Salma Hayek says Donald Trump planted a story about her because she rejected his romantic advances.The &apos;Sausage Party&apos; actress has claimed the 70-year-old US presidential hopeful - who is 20 years her senior - harassed her for a&#xA0;date and when she refused him he leaked fake information to the National Enquirer newspaper saying he had, in fact, turned her down because of her height.She said: &quot;When I met that man, I had a boyfriend, and he tried to become his friend to get my home telephone number. He got my number and he would call me to invite me out.&quot;When I told him I wouldn&apos;t go out with him even if I didn&apos;t have a boyfriend, [which he took as disrespectful], he called - well, he&#xA0;wouldn&apos;t say he called, but someone (from his camp) told the National Enquirer.&quot;Someone told the National Enquirer. I&apos;m not going to say who, because you know that whatever he wants to come out comes out in the National Enquirer. It said that he wouldn&apos;t go out with me because I was too short.&quot;Salma - who is now married to billionaire businessman Fran&#xE7;ois-Henri Pinault with whom she has eight-year-old daughter Valentina - revealed Donald called her after and tried to convince her they should prove the story was incorrect by dating.Speaking about his bizarre pick-up method, she told Radio Centro 93.9&apos;s &apos;El Show del Mandril: &quot;Later, he called and left me a message.&apos;Can you believe this? Who would say this? I don&apos;t want people to think this about you.&apos; He thought that I would try to go out with him so people wouldn&apos;t think that&apos;s why he wouldn&apos;t go out with me.&quot;Bang Showbiz
