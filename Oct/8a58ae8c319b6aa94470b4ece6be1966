According to orthopaedist Reinhard Schneiderhan, there are five common causes of back pain, and sufferers should apply a different strategy to each. 1. Sitting for long periods of time can cause muscle strain and lead to tension and pain in the back. Schneiderhan recommends you carve out some leisure-activity time in your day to do walks, pilates or yoga to compensate. 2. In situations where there is limited movement, the musculature weakens and the intervertebral discs of the spine do not receive an adequate amount of water and nutrients. Try a sport like jogging or swimming that twists the spine, Schneiderhan says. The pumping movement allows the discs to soak up liquid, and prevents pain.

Being overweight places additional strain on the back, but especially on the lower back, where the intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers between the vertebrae of the spine. Lose weight for your own benefit. 4. Stress can also lead to muscle tension. Schneiderhan recommends finding ways to reduce mental stress in your life. Strengthening the back muscles helps too.

Use a backpack, or distribute the weight to both arms, Schneiderhan says. For example, when going shopping, it is best to use two small bags instead of one big one. Learn to lift heavy items by straightening the legs instead of the back.
