Nine Australian men who stripped down to Speedo-style swimming trunks bearing the Malaysian flag at a Formula One race south of Kuala Lumpur over the weekend appeared in court on Thursday and pleaded guilty to causing a public nuisance, media reports said. The charge carries a fine not exceeding 400 ringgit (97 dollars) and no jail time, the Malaysia Star reported. “The Australians have been cautioned and discharged. No conviction recorded. They are free to leave,” the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Samantha Hawley wrote on Twitter. The men, aged between 25 and 29, were arrested in Sepang on Sunday after removing their clothes while celebrating Australian Daniel Ricciardo's victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Underneath their outerwear, the Australian race car fans were wearing skimpy swimwear printed with the Malaysian flag. Malaysians protested against the Australian men's actions on social media and in news reports, calling their behaviour disrespectful and lacking in cultural sensitivity. One of the nine Australians arrested, Jack Walker, is an adviser to Australian cabinet minister Christopher Pyne. Malaysian police had said the men were intoxicated when the incident took place. The men also reportedly drank beer from their shoes.
