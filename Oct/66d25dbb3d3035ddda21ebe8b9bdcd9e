Cape Town - It takes seconds to share or even  click “like” on social media posts, but the resultant damage of such a simple action could haunt you for ever and may leave you with a criminal record. And more so when the material you share involves a minor, experts warn. “We’re concerned about any abusive behaviour and have made efforts to promote an environment where everyone on Facebook can connect and share comfortably,” Facebook said in an e-mail. This is after two so-called “bullying” video clips involving minors went viral on Facebook. One was of  a Cape Town teen. Someone named her in later Facebook comments, and comments mocking her ensued. The second video clip emerged from Durban, depicting a teenage boy assaulting a fellow pupil. Both videos attracted widespread reaction and commentary from Facebook users. Professor Ann Skelton of the Centre for Child Law at the University of Pretoria warned that anyone who spreads video clips or information involving minors could get into trouble. “The identity of child victims and witnesses, as well as child offenders, is protected by the Criminal Procedure Act. “Any person who forwards such a video is breaching that provision. It is an offence, for which a person may be charged.” Weekend Argus
