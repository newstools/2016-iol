He has been one of the stand-out players for the Stormers and Western Province, and now Huw Jones has been recognised for his contribution by his teammates. Jones, who made his Test debut for Scotland in June, was voted as the Players’ Player of the Year at the Western Province Awards evening at Newlands on Tuesday night. The 22-year-old – who was born in Scotland and raised in England – has been in thrilling form for WP in the Currie Cup at centre and is one of the main reasons why Province scraped into the semi-finals, where they will face the Blue Bulls at Loftus Versfeld on October 15. His speed and stepping ability from midfield has been one of the few highlights for WP, but he first made his name with a string of classy outings for the Stormers in Super Rugby despite limited opportunities behind Springbok pair Juan de Jongh and Damian de Allende at various stages, while Johnny Kotze was also preferred by coach Robbie Fleck. Jones was impressive whenever he took to the field, and the fact that he was unlucky not to feature regularly for the Stormers may have been part of the reason why his peers voted for him as their best player. The other big winner on the night was Springbok lock Pieter-Steph du Toit, who made his presence felt immediately in his first season at the Stormers with several imposing displays. Du Toit won the MVP (most valuable award), which is well deserved as he added lineout precision and mobility in the second row alongside Eben Etzebeth, which they have continued in the Bok team. Bongi Mbonambi and Cheslin Kolbe were voted as the best forward and back respectively, while SA Schools captain and lock Salmaan Moerat was chosen as the Schools Player of the Year.
