Prospecton, Durban - It's been four years since Toyota launched the current-generation Avanza compact MPV on the South African market, but it has received a number of updates since then, notably to exterior trim and a revised dashboard. But the latest update, announced today along with revised pricing, is not something you'll see from the outside. Nevertheless, it's a significant upgrade from an active safety point of view: from now on all new Avanza models in South Africa will come with vehicle stability control, including brake assist and traction control, as standard issue. ABS, of course, is already standard across the range - as are electronic brake force distribution, driver and front passenger airbags, and three-point seatbelts, introduced a year ago. The current line-up of five MPV models plus the panel van remains otherwise unchanged, while their prices go up by R4400 across the board. New Prices - Toyota Avanza 1.3 S: R219 100 1.3 SX: R235 900 1.5 SX: R243 100 1.5 SX AT: R261 600 1.5 TX: R277 100 1.3 S Panel Van: R224 400 Motoring.co.za  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter   Subscribe to our Newsletter
