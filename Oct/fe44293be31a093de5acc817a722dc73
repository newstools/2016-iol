Cape Town - Normal school activities could not take place at the Academy Private School in Kuils River as pupils and staff struggled to come to terms with the death of their deputy principal, Dr Anton Diedericks.Diedericks, affectionately known as Dr D, was shot dead on Tuesday afternoon in Mandalay after he took a pupil, who fell ill, home.Diedericks was caught in an alleged attempted hijacking.The police say four men approached him and fired into his car, shooting him in the neck.The men fled the scene in a blue Toyota Avanza and are still at large.The school&#x2019;s principal, Zandra Duvenhage, said the fact that Diedericks was willing to take time out of his day to drop the pupil at home showed the kind of person he was.&#x201C;He did this final deed on his own accord and did not tell any staff member that he was going to do it, although the pupils in the class and the girl&#x2019;s family knew about it.&#x201D;Duvenhage said the school was &#x201C;terribly shocked by the incident&#x201D;.&#x201C;Dr D was not only a beloved teacher, who taught business studies and tourism, he was also a kind of a father figure to many of our pupils.&#x201D;She said they would debrief pupils this week and have arranged for psychologists from the department of education, and counsellors to assist with debriefing.&#x201C;All extra curricular activities are cancelled for the rest of the week and the teacher development and training that is supposed to take place is also postponed.&#x201D;Past pupils and his family described Diedericks as a kind man, and offered their condolences to the family.Nicol Carstens, who was taught geography by Diedericks in the 1990s, said he admired his late teacher for his discipline.Carstens said Diedericks encouraged them to run and also competed in 10 Comrades Marathons.&#x201C;I will never forget. In 1994, he was struggling with kidney stones and he stressed the importance of drinking water. He was a man who did not just talk the talk, but he walked the walk.&#x201C;He always ran with the children, he did not just tell them what to do, he was there running next to them.&#x201D;Carstens said he would be running his first Comrades Marathon next year in honour of Diedericks and another former teacher who was killed.Diedericks previously taught at De Kuilen High School and his niece Lize Fouche said: &#x201C;He was my uncle, who would someone do that to another person? We are very upset and deeply shocked.&#x201D;Police spokeswoman Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said police had no new developments and the investigation was ongoing.Anyone with information can call Detective Sergeant Marco van Neel on 021 377 5000 at Lentegeur police station.
