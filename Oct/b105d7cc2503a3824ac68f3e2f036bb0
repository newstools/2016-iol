Tshwane - A total of 831 people have been arrested in connection with the ongoing #FeesMustFall protests which have rocked universities and other higher education institutions across South Africa, acting National Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane said on Friday.&#x201C;The increase [in the number of arrests] can be attributed to the increase in the number of incidents of violent behaviour. Earlier, when the #FeesMustFall protests started, we didn&#x2019;t have many incidents happening outside the premises of the institutions of higher learning,&#x201D; Phahlane told reporters at a media briefing in Pretoria.&#x201C;The trend [by protesting students] lately is to try and distract the police, move away from the institutions and go on the rampage outside, as it happened in Braamfontein [Johannesburg]. You would have noted the number of vehicles that were torched outside the [Witwatersrand] university.&#x201D;Phahlane said the students, of late, frequently protest during the night, leaving a trail of destruction by morning.He emphasised that not all, of the 831 people arrested since February, are behind bars. Some got released on bail.&#x201C;That figure I presented to you is a national figure. We do not, at this stage, have the provincial breakdown. At the opportune moment we will do so.&#x201D;Several campuses around the country have experienced violence and unrest since higher education minister Blade Nzimande&#x2019;s announcement on September 19, that universities should decide on their own fee increases for the 2017 academic year.Nzimande placed a cap of eight percent on the increases and said they should be transparent and inflation-linked, although poor and the so-called &#x201C;missing middle&#x201D; would be exempt from fee increases.
