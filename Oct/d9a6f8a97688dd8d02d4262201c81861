Johannesburg - A new online shop for automotive parts has been launched in South Africa. After selling car parts and accessories on Takealot since early 2015, Start My Car has launched its own online shop on www.startmycar.co.za which lists scores of products ranging from car filters and windscreen wipers to portable power stations and service kits. The site focuses on mostly generic automotive accessories and car care products, along with tools and tyre repair. Thereâ€™s a replacement parts section, with air filters and brake pads, for a small handful of models on sale in SA. Start My Car delivers anywhere in South Africa with a fast turnaround time. Deliveries to Johannesburg take approximately 24 to 48 hours and up to 72 hours to other regions. Star Motoring
