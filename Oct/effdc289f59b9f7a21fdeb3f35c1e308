Port Elizabeth - A seasoned Eastern Cape top cop told the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday, that there was &#x201C;nothing sinister&#x201D; about Christopher Panayiotou&#x2019;s bouncer being taken to Fort Beaufort to make a statement.Panayiotou&#x2019;s lawyers have previously claimed that at the time of Luthando Siyoni&#x2019;s arrest in April last year, he was severely beaten into making a confession.Siyoni was employed by Panayiotou as a bouncer at his Infinity nightclub. The State alleges Panayiotou paid Siyoni to hire hitman Sizwe Vumazonke to kidnap and murder his wife Jayde in April last year.Brigadier Gary McLaren testified on Friday in the ongoing murder trial involving Panayiotou and his two co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko.McLaren told the court that after he had been informed of Siyoni&#x2019;s arrest he had recommended an officer from outside the Port Elizabeth area to take down his statement.Prosecutor Marius Stander asked McLaren to elaborate on his reasons for moving Siyoni to which he replied: &#x201C;There was a Jayde frenzy in PE, I felt it better to utilise someone who was not from PE...because of the investigation it was important to keep arrest confined to investigation team and because of the media it was difficult to keep anything under wraps.&#x201D;McLaren said that the procedure was &#x201C;nothing out of the ordinary&#x201D;.McLaren was responsible for setting up a task team to investigate Jayde&#x2019;s case. He also told the court about events subsequent to the arrest of alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke on May 3, last year. Vumazonke has since died.He said that when police first brought Vumazonke in he immediately noticed that his eye was swollen. McLaren said he informed Vumazonke of his rights and told him that he had been implicated by Siyoni.&#x201C;He vehemently denied his involvement, he said he was being implicated because Siyoni was more scared of the gangsters than they were of him,&#x201D; he said.He said Vumazonke then requested to see Siyoni who was being held at Kabega Park Police Station at the time.McLaren then travelled with Vumazonke to the police station where he asked Siyoni to confirm the identity of Vumazonke.At this point Defence Advocate Terry Price interjected and said that Vumazonke pointed to Siyoni&#x2019;s face and told him &#x201C;they did to you what they did to me,&#x201D; referring to injuries and allegedly being beaten by police.However McLaren denied that happened and said that he actually had to take Vumazonke away as he was becoming aggressive during the meeting and accused Siyoni of lying.Price will start with cross examination on Monday.
