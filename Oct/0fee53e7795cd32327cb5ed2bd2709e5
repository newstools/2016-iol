Mexico City - Supporters of US Republican candidate Donald Trump unwittingly helped pick up the tab for a booze-up in Mexico City on Thursday.Scroll down for videoThey were duped into buying cleverly concealed anti-Trump T-shirts designed by a local brewery.Trump, who has labelled Mexicans rapists and drug runners, has caused outrage south of the border with his vow to build a border wall that Mexico will pay for - a pledge that inspired brewer Cerveza Cucapa&apos;s ingenious scheme to get Trump supporters to cough up for Mexicans&apos; brews.&quot;It&apos;s amazing that we can have a party paid for by Donald Trump!&quot; said 54-year-old Leticia Villanueva, cradling her free beer at the event which had attracted a few hundred people.Late last month, Cucapa, an artisanal brewery from the northern border state of Baja California, posted a video in which representatives went to the United States to hawk blue T-shirts with Trump&apos;s face that ostensibly said &quot;I support Donald.&quot;However, unbeknown to the buyer, when they put on the T-shirt, their body temperature adds a clown&apos;s nose to Trump&apos;s face and alters the message to read &quot;Donald: El que lo Lea,&quot; a traditional message meaning &quot;Whoever reads this is Donald.&quot;Proceeds from the tongue-in-cheek publicity stunt helped fund the event on Thursday in Mexico City, where a well-heeled crowd of young boozers in bright yellow Trump wigs took cheer from the property mogul&apos;s recent collapse in the polls.&quot;His campaign is garbage, and the only good thing he&apos;s ever done is get us drunk,&quot; said 21-year-old Ivan Grajeda. &quot;It&apos;s great that he&apos;s losing... that&apos;s a triumph for Mexico.&quot;Others hoped that their family in the United States would turn out and vote in the November 8 election for Hillary Clinton, who has strengthened her lead against Trump in recent weeks after her Republican rival faced a string of groping allegations.&quot;I ask my family members over there to vote for Hillary, as it&apos;s not in their interests for Trump to win,&quot; said Jose Ramon Trevino, 28. &quot; I have family in Chicago and they are hard-working people, who don&apos;t go looking for problems or beg for money in the street.&quot;Esteban Pacheco, a 26-year-old Cucapa employee, said the aim of the brewer&apos;s campaign was to build bridges between the two countries.&quot;We want to unite the people with these types of activities,&quot; he said.
