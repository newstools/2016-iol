&nbsp;Parliament - President Jacob Zuma has expressed support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in his legal troubles with the National Prosecuting Authority.&nbsp;But Zuma told MPs in the National Council of Provinces on Tuesday he will not interfere with the law.&nbsp;Zuma has been under pressure in recent days to intervene in the prosecution of Gordhan, but on Tuesday he reiterated his position that he will not be able to do so. A few weeks ago Zuma expressed the same sentiments that he respected the law and he was bound by the law.&nbsp;He said despite calls for him to intervene in the case he cannot do so as the law has to take its course.&nbsp;Gordhan is due to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court next Wednesday on fraud charges.&nbsp;But Zuma, who was answering oral questions in the NCOP, said he cannot be seen to be interfering with law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;No person including the President of the country can interfere with the work of the NPA or any agency.&nbsp;Earlier the EFF tried to block Zuma from answering oral questions in the NCOP after accusing him of serious breach of the Constitution.&nbsp;This led to NCOP chairwoman Thandi Modise to eject the EFF MPs for disrupting proceedings of the House.Political Bureau&nbsp;
