Parliament - President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday said if he was to interfere in the prosecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on fraud charges, South Africa could become a banana republic.Responding to questions in the National Council of Provinces, Zuma said, as president, he could not interfere in court processes.&#x201C;No individual is given a right&#x2026; to interfere with independent processes and decisions of independent institutions,&#x201D; said Zuma.&#x201C;I think if this President was to interfere in any matter, either of chapter nine institutions or other institutions, then it would be close to a banana republic.&#x201D; African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
