Parliament - President Jacob Zuma on Friday announced the resignation of another board member of the embattled South African Broadcasting Corporation.&#x201C;President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignation of Ms Leah Thabisile Khumalo as a member and Deputy Chairperson of the Board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), with immediate effect,&#x201D; the presidency said in a statement.&#x201C;The president has thanked Ms Khumalo for her contribution during her tenure at the SABC and wished her well in all her future endeavours.&#x201D;Her resignation brings to three the number of resignations Zuma accepted from SABC board members this month.Board members Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso told MPs of their intention to quit while briefing Parliament&#x2019;s portfolio committee on communications. Both criticised the way in which board business was being conducted, saying they were being sidelined when important decisions were being made.At the same meeting the committee resolved to institute a parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the board to hold office.That inquiry, which was meant to get underway this week, was delayed as the committee said it needed to follow proper legal processes, including sending notices of inquiry to the remaining three board members - chairman Obert Maghuve, Nomvuyo Mhlakaza and Aaron Tshidzumba.All three have refused to resign, with a defiant Maghuve calling a media briefing a day after the committee meeting where he accused MPs of trying to &#x201C;bully&#x201D; him.The resolution for an inquiry came after Maguvhe and acting group chief executive officer James Aguma defended their decision to appoint the ever controversial Hlaudi Motsoeneng to the senior post of chief executive for corporate affairs.The appointment came after the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) would not entertain an appeal of a high court decision invalidating his appointment as chief operating officer.
