Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma’s office said it’s concerned by the “relentless public attacks” on him by leaders of Sibanye Gold and AngloGold Ashanti. The presidency issued the statement after recent calls by AngloGold Ashanti Chairman Sipho Pityana and Sibanye Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman urging Zuma to resign, arguing that his government’s poor record is deterring investment and economic growth. While Zuma respects freedom of speech, “such dialogue is more helpful if it takes place within the bounds of human decency and decorum and upholds respect for key institutions in our country”, the presidency said Thursday in an emailed statement. Zuma, 74, has faced calls to quit since the nation’s top court ruled in March that he violated the constitution by refusing to repay taxpayer money spent on upgrading his private home. He’s spooked investors by sparring with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for control of the Treasury, tax-collection agency and state companies. He’s also fighting a lawsuit filed by opposition parties aimed at forcing prosecutors to reinstate 783 graft counts against him that were dropped just weeks before he became president in 2009. * With assistance from Kevin Crowley Bloomberg
