Alpecin Tuning Shampoo protects your dark shade with intense colour pigments and helps prevent hair loss without a result of a medical conditionÂ while you wash your hair. Alpecin Tuning Shampoo helps hair look darker and fuller - the colour effect is inconspicuous and only becomes more intense with regular use. It washes out gradually with normal shampoo (try Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo C1). Alpecin Caffeine, the active ingredient which helps fight hair loss,  can be detected in the hair after just 120 seconds of washing.
