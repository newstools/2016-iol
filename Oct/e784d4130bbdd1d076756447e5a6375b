Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#x2019;s case against the National Prosecuting Authority appears to have been bolstered.Gordhan will appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on Wednesday with former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and another former Sars senior official, Ivan Pillay.The Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) and Freedom Under Law have opposed the case, saying the charges were flimsy.However, the emergence of a video of a senior Sars official being forced by the Hawks to hand over documents linked to Gordhan&#x2019;s charges has raised questions. Sars and the Hawks said they would investigate an incident where deputy director for law administration Vlok Symington was allegedly held hostage by the Hawks to hand over printed e-mails on the charges against the minister. A crucial e-mail had mistakenly been sent to Symington.The Independent Police Investigative Directorate said it was investigating the case after Symington lodged a complaint against the Hawks.Also this week, director for the foundation Francis Antonie filed supplementary affidavits in the High Court questioning the NPA&#x2019;s decision to charge Gordhan. In the papers, Antonie said it had obtained information from the Government Pensions Administration Agency that from 2005-2010, more than 3 000 public servants were given early retirement.This is the same charge that the NPA has filed against Gordhan, for approving the early retirement of Pillay before he reached the age of 60.Antonie said the NPA did not do enough to seek this information from the agency before charging Gordhan. It was clear that charges against him were flimsy and without basis.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
