Johannesburg - MTN Group appointed Felleng Sekha to the newly created position of head of regulatory affairs, part of a management shakeup at the wireless carrier following a record $1 billion fine in Nigeria, according to three people familiar with the matter. Sekha previously worked for MTN’s Nigeria unit for almost nine years ending in 2007, according to her LinkedIn page. The account states her present position as managing partner at government relations specialists IQS Strategic Public Affairs. Sekha declined to comment when contacted by phone on Monday. The creation of a new executive position is part of MTN Chairman Phuthuma Nhleko’s plan to shore up management and governance structures as the Johannesburg-based company makes sure there’s no repeat of the record fine levied in Nigeria, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as Sekha’s appointment hasn’t been made public.
