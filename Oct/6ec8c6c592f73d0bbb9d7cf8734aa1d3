Cape Town &#x2013; A police official appeared in a court in Cape Town on Tuesday, accused of corruptly requesting money from two suspects, for their release from custody.Harold Deon Jacobs, 41, formerly based at the Kraaifontein police station in Cape Town&#x2019;s northern suburbs, faces charges of fraud and corruption.He appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Bellville, before magistrate Sabrina Sonnenberg on Tuesday.On the fraud charge, prosecutor Thersia du Toit-Smit alleges that he falsely informed a woman who had been arrested for shoplifting, in July last year, that she would be released if she paid a R500 admission of guilt.It is alleged that Jacobs accepted R300 instead, from the woman&#x2019;s husband, but that he failed to issue a receipt for it and kept the money for himself.On the corruption charge, he is alleged to have requested a R2 000 bribe from a suspect who had been arrested on a charge of assault, for his release, the day after Christmas last year.On the suspect&#x2019;s arrival at the police station on the assault charge, police officials removed R3 900 cash from him for safe-keeping, but first photocopied the notes for their serial numbers, before locking the cash in a safe.It is alleged that the suspect paid the R2 000, and was released.A police captain at the station became suspicious, and summoned Jacobs to the captain&#x2019;s office.Jacobs was searched, and the R2 000 found in his possession.The serial numbers of all but two of the notes in Jacobs&#x2019; possession corresponded with the serial numbers on the photocopies, it is alleged.The charge sheet did not disclose Jacobs&#x2019; rank.He was warned to appear in court again on November 18.
