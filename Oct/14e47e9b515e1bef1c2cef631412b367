Pretoria - The name Junior is the top favourite among South African parents when they christen their male children at birth, the Statistician-General of South Africa, Dr Pali Lehohla, revealed on Thursday.&#x201C;There is a whole lot of sociology and anthropological issues surrounding the act of birth. By 2015, the names like Bandile or Siyabonga had dropped. They have been replaced by Prince, Blessing or Gift,&#x201D; Lehohla said while releasing reports on recorded live births for 2013 to 2015 and perinatal deaths for 2014, in Pretoria on Thursday.&#x201C;Give [newborn babies] names like Junior or Baby is OK, so that the registration process can proceed. We have so many people called Baby because the father or grandmother will still have to be told that the child has been born, and we didn&#x2019;t know whether it was going to be a boy or a girl and there is no prescription of names.&#x201D;He said in some cultures it was taboo to name a child before birth, and in some instances the baby could only be named after a few days of birth.In the same survey, StatsSA found that for newborn girls, South African parents mostly named their children Precious, Princess or Angel.Names including Minenhle, Faith, Lesedi, Thandolwethu are still in the top ten popularity list, but their use had declined.The surnames Dlamini, Nkosi and Ndlovu were respectively at the apex on the top ten distribution of baby surnames registered in 2015.The 2013-2015 recorded live births report also indicated that in 2015, there was a total of 1,084,511 birth registrations, and more than 87 percent of these were current registrations, while 12,3 percent were late registrations.Lehohla said while an increasing number of births were being registered in the year of birth, there was a need for parents to increase the timeliness of birth registrations. Parents were encouraged to register their newborn babies within 30 days of birth as stipulated in the Birth and Death Registration Act.On the 2014 perinatal deaths report, Lehohla said a decrease of 3,6 percent was recorded in comparison to the previous year. The figures were at 22,274 in 2013 and the number shrunk to 21,908 in 2014.Statistics indicated higher males babies deaths compared to their female counterparts. Overall results show that in 2014, there were 122 male perinatal deaths for every 100 female babies who succumbed.Perinatal deaths encompass both stillbirths, which are foetuses delivered without signs of life, and early neonatal deaths, which refer to babies that die in the first week after birth.
