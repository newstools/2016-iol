Durban - Spion Kop Lodge is situated midway between Durban and Joburg, established by Raymond and Lynette Heron in 1998. It’s a family-owned and operated lodge. It’s a place in Africa, an oasis in a pleasant expanse of grassland, on a 703-hectare working farm at the foot of the mighty Drakensberg mountains of KwaZulu-Natal. A place where one is able to escape the world and live in tranquillity for a moment in time. At Spion Kop one hears tales of the fierce battles of Boer, Brit and Zulu, the long-ago sounds of warriors, horsemen and soldiers. One is reminded of these by  resident historians Raymond  Heron, FRGS, and Alastair Heron, who paint a vivid picture of the personal trauma and military mindset that resulted in the slaughter of so many British and Boer soldiers during the South African War of 1899-1902. The war involved three significant characters of modern history - Winston Churchill, who became the Prime Minister of Great Britain; Louis Botha, who became the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa in 1910; and Mahatma Gandhi, who was a stretcher-bearer with the volunteer Ambulance Corps. Activities include battlefield tours, sunset boat cruises, game drives, hiking, mountain biking, and Drakensberg Boys Choir recitals. In the evening, one can savour wholesome meals and fine wines. It is a unique destination with activities that satisfy the needs of both national and international guests who have varied interests of berg, bush and battlefields.
