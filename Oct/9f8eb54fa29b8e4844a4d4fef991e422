Parliament - Pressure continues to mount on President Jacob Zuma to reshuffle his cabinet and axe Communications Minister Faith Muthambi for the crisis at the SABC. Zuma has previously denied any changes to the national executive are imminent, but it is understood the president is under pressure to fire Muthambi. Zumaâ€™s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga could not be reached for comment on Friday. Muthambi is not the only minister earmarked for the axe. The president is in discussion with Minerals Minister Mosebenzi Zwane over his remarks  the cabinet had decided on a judicial commission of inquiry to probe the banks for dumping the Guptas early this year. Zwane has been touted for a less controversial portfolio at Water and Sanitation, with the incumbent Nomvula Mokonyane to be shifted to a more senior post at Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. A few weeks ago Zuma denied rumours of a cabinet reshuffle, which he suggested were a bid to destabilise his government. However, pressure to get rid of Muthambi continued to grow and Zuma is now expected to act. In his first term of office Zuma had three cabinet reshuffles in three years, making him the first head of state in democratic South Africa to make so many changes to his executive. Former president Nelson Mandela did not have a major reshuffle in his one term as president. Nor did his successor, Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki was strongly criticised for keeping the deadwood in his executive, but he stuck with his ministers. Zuma has expanded his cabinet and chopped and changed it several times in his first term. In his second term he first reshuffled his cabinet after former Public Service and Administration Minister Collins Chabane died in a car crash. He brought in Zwane from the Free State and put him at Minerals, and moved Ngoako Ramathlodi to Public Service. But the major shake-up was the axing of Nhlanhla Nene from the Treasury, in favour of  Des van Rooyen. Political Bureau
