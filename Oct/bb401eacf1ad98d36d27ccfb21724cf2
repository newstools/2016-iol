We attended the official spring/summer 2017 PICHULIK launch and got a glimpse of their new #PichulikByNadya resort wear collection. The launch took place at the Gorgeous George Hotel, which is set to open in 2018. This was also the brand's second collaboration with Cape Town brand, Espadril.  The collection moved away from the brand's original vibrant hues, but the influences remained. Think rose gold, dusty pinks, soft sand and neutral shades adding a feminine touch inspired by grace, wisdom and being fierce.  Owner and designer, Katherine-Mary Pichiluk, said she doesn't trace their jewellery designs to a specific period, but rather see the designs as descendants of Central Indian ceremonial jewels, Middle-Eastern ornamentation and byzantine gold and gemstone embellishments of gold and stones.  "This collection is incredibly feminine and the colours are softer because of the desert influences. I guess it's because I am also in love at the moment and my general take on things is softer and gentler. We really wanted to pare the pieces down to the brand’s essence, which has always been considered materials, sensitive and attentive craftsmanship, and ancient wisdom," adds Pichulik.  The jewellery is echoed in the second PICHULIK by Nadya von Stein clothing collection. "The garments are inspired by the travelling garments of the ’30s and are made from hand-dyed hemp in natural hues. The lines are clean and the focus is on function as much as fashion," says Von Stein.  The spring/summer 2017 collection will be available online at pichulik.com on 14 October 2016 and at the PICHULIK stores in the V&A Watershed as well as AKJP Collective in Cape Town.
