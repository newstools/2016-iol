London - An actress in adult films is the latest in a series of women to come forward accusing Donald Trump of unwanted sexual advances.Scroll down for videoIn a statement, Jessica Drake said the property tycoon offered her $10,000 (&#xA3;8,100) and use of his private jet to come to his room alone.The porn star and sex educator is one of at least 11 women to make claims that the Republican nominee groped them, forcibly kissed them or made inappropriate remarks.She made the allegations at a news conference organised by Gloria Allred, a renowned discrimination attorney who has introduced two other of Trump&#x2019;s accusors to the public.Drake said in a statement the tycoon &#x201C;grabbed&#x201D; her and another woman and kissed them on the lips without permission.The 42-year-old said she met Mr Trump at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in California in 2006.&#x201C;He flirted with me and invited me to walk along the golf course with him,&#x201D; she said.He then asked her to go to his hotel room, Drake said, and she and two other women went along.They were dressed in pyjamas and, when they entered, Trump &#x201C;grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission,&#x201D; she said.After she returned to her room, Drake said the billionaire called her and asked her to go to a party with him and for her to return to his room alone.He asked her: &#x201C;What do you want? How much?&#x201D;When she refused, Drake said she received another call either from Trump or another man offering her $10,000 and use of a private plane if she agreed.In support of the statement, Allred showed the news conference a photograph of Drake and the Republican candidate at the golf tournament.The lawyer is well-known for taking on high-profile cases such as those against Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski.The Trump campaign issued a statement denying the fresh allegations, saying: &#x201C;This story is totally false and ridiculous.&#x201D;It added: &#x201C;Mr Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her.&#x201C;This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls.&#x201D;It held the allegations up as &#x201C;another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election.&#x201D;The Republican candidate has struggled to shake multiple allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour, although he has claimed: &#x201C;Nobody has more respect for women than I do.&#x201D;Trump and his companies have been accused of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at least 20 times.Out of 130 employment cases, there are 20 detailed complaints from women who described a culture of sexual harassment dating back to the early 1980s.The Trump campaign has nosedived following the release of a tape where he described groping women without their permission and bookkeepers have slashed the odds of a Republican president.The billionaire Republican has said one of his top priorities within his first 100 days of his presidency is to sue all the women who have accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour.
