Washington, United States - President Barack Obama has suggested that decisions on who hosts the Olympics are corrupt, in a wide-ranging interview that touched on Chicago's failed 2016 bid. In an interview published late Sunday, Obama recalled his 2009 travel to Copenhagen in a failed effort to get his adopted home city across the finishing line. "Everybody thought that if I flew out there we had a good chance of getting it, and it might be worth essentially just taking a one-day trip," Obama told New York magazine. "Subsequently, I think we've learned that IOC's decisions are similar to Fifa's decisions: a little bit cooked," he said comparing the International Olympic Committee to football's scandalized governing body. The loss for Chicago was seen as a political blow for Obama. Rio eventually emerged from a crowded field to win the right to host the games. AFP
