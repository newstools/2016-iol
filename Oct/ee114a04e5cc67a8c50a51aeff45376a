Rapper AKA took to Twitter on Friday to tell fans that his relationship with VTH Season and his manager Raphael Benza was over. The ‘Baddest’ hit-maker did not go into much detail over what led to the split although he hinted at the fact that whatever transpired was “too big” to come back from. The hip hop star wrote, “much worse” as a reply to a fan who had asked if AKA had just had a fall out with VTH Season. Known for being extremely vocal, the rapper also did not shy away from throwing shade at the now former manager Benza. “Nobody wants to deal with Raphael Benza .... This is not a secret,” he wrote.  Don't stress y'all, this means more music, more growth & most importantly for myself and my family .... More money & a better future. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 14, 2016  VTH Season AKA is DEAD. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 14, 2016  You have not yet seen the best of Kiernan Forbes.

Thank You for your support, but it's time to build something for our own children,” the rapper assured fans. It seems AKA is ready to build an empire for Kairo and perhaps also hinting that he and Queen B might be starting a family soon. I been quietly going about my business setting up my own company for the last few months now. — AKA (@akaworldwide) October 14, 2016  Our new office space, some work to be done to get it up to scratch 💻💡 ...
