Oklahoma City - The Oklahoma man who&apos;s been wanted since Sunday in a string of violent crimes, including the killings of two relatives, had a hit list purporting to target several more people, authorities said on Tuesday.Michael Dale Vance Jr, a 38-year-old man from Chandler, Oklahoma, is wanted on multiple charges, including two counts of first-degree murder. He was last seen early on Monday about 30 miles from the Texas border in western Oklahoma - 165 miles from where the manhunt began Sunday night in Wellston.&quot;Obviously, as long as he isn&apos;t apprehended, we&apos;re extremely concerned about those he may have indicated that he wishes harm to,&quot; Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel told The Oklahoman newspaper on Tuesday. &quot;Most of those are outside of Oklahoma County.&quot;The FBI is co-ordinating the search for Vance among several federal, state and local agencies and is deliberately being tight-lipped so Vance isn&apos;t tipped off to their efforts, spokesman Terry Weber said in a statement.&quot;This investigation is ongoing and any premature release of information regarding the apprehension efforts of Mr Vance can negatively impact these efforts to safely apprehend (him),&quot; Weber said.Whetsel also said law enforcement was providing protection for the people on the alleged hit list.The search began on Sunday night after two police officers were shot and wounded as they responded to shots fired in Wellston, about 35 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. The Lincoln County Sheriff&apos;s Office said one person was arrested, but Vance fled in a patrol vehicle.Vance is suspected of later shooting a woman and stealing her vehicle at a mobile home park near Wellston, then driving about 8 miles to his relatives&apos; mobile home in Luther and killing them, Oklahoma County Sheriff&apos;s Office spokesman Mark Opgrande said.Ronald Everett Wilkson, 55, had been shot and had stab wounds to his neck &quot;consistent with an attempt to sever his head,&quot; an arrest affidavit said. Valerie Kay Wilkson, 54, had similar neck wounds along with defensive wounds on her arms, the affidavit stated.Authorities also believe Vance filmed two Facebook Live videos documenting his run from police before going to the Wilksons&apos; home.In one video, a man wearing a backward baseball cap and a shirt that appears to be covered in blood says he&apos;s about to steal another vehicle and that it&apos;s &quot;gonna be intense.&quot; In another, which seems to be filmed inside a second vehicle, the same man says: &quot;Letting y&apos;all know, look, this is real,&quot; before panning to a long gun on the passenger seat.He said: &quot;If you want to know what&apos;s up next, stay tuned to your local news.&quot;Investigators believe Wellston police shot Vance at least once Sunday evening, and that the bloodied shirt found at his relatives&apos; home is the same one he is apparently wearing in the video as he complains, &quot;It hurts.&quot;Vance also is suspected of shooting a man in the leg in an attempted carjacking early on Monday at a convenience store in Sayre, about 30 miles from the Texas border. Sayre Police Chief Ronnie Harrold said the man identified Vance as the man who shot him.The arrest warrant for Vance also includes charges of an unauthorised use of a motor vehicle and possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony. Court records show Vance has been charged in the sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl in Lincoln County and has a court hearing Novembe. 7.AP IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
