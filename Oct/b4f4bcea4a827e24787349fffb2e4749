Victoria Beckham's "favourite" eye shadow colours are blue and green. The 42-year-old fashion designer, who joined forces with the luxury cosmetics brand Estée Lauder earlier this year and has designed a limited edition Autumn/Winter 2016 beauty capsule for the brand, has revealed she can't stop wearing the electric blue and forest green shades in the Victoria Beckham x Estée Lauder eye palette because they are "strong fashion stories" for the season, and are hues which featured in her latest ready to wear fashion line. Speaking in her Instagram story about her beauty essentials, which she always carries with her, the brunette beauty said: "For me I really like the green and the blue [in the eye palette]. "So these are my favourite colours. My favourites being the blue and the green because these are strong fashion stories for this season, they were the colours that I used in my latest ready to wear." And the fashion mogul - who has sons Brooklyn, 17, Romeo, 14, Cruz, 11, and five-year-old daughter Harper with her husband David Beckham - has also revealed she swears by the illuminator called Morning Aura from her range, which leaves her with a "youthful, L.A. glow". She added: "This is Morning Aura, this is a primer, a moisturiser, it lifts, and it tightens. "So, this gives you a natural, fresh, youthful, L.A glow. This is must-have hero piece in the collection. Buy this at VictoriaBeckham.com, Estee Lauder. "[And] This is a make-up bag that I did - limited edition - to sit nicely with the collection." The Spice Girls band member has admitted she designed the collection to fill the gaps in the market. She explained: "You know I wanted to create pieces that I couldn't find out there, things that I wanted in my make-up bag, those key must-have items that every woman should have."
