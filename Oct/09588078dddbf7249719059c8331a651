Moonchild is a loose woman - and proud of it! But that’s only when she’s letting loose with her man. In an interview with Z’khipani recently, she said, “I am my man's ‘ho’. I do everything with my man. I have names. I have wigs. I have costumes. I do everything and I am very vocal. He is very vocal,” Moonchild says. The flamboyant singer with the sexy style is not afraid of being in touch with her sexuality - both in life and in her music. The Rabubi star says that those are the elements to a “good sex life” and explained that it's important for women to be assertive in the bedroom. “You can't be polite in the bedroom. You need to say what you want... you have to keep spicing things up and keep it fresh,” she says. Fresh from a tour across Europe, America and Africa, recently released a song that encourages women to be bold and open about what they want from their partner in the bedroom.   She also has revealed her past experience as a victim of sexual violence, but refuses to let it rob her of her power. “I can't change what happened and I definitely refuse to play victim and if the cops can't or won't do anything about it, I'll just write another song. I have no reason to not own what I have - I'm not going to apologise for it to anyone,” she said in a previous interview with The Times. IOL
