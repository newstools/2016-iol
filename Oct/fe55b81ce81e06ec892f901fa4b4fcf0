Cape Town - “[Yes, it’s true] Everything on our menu is only R10. All day... everyday!” This is the post on Xpresso Cafe’s Facebook page. It’s a joke right? How can everything on a cafe’s menu be R10? The little coffee shop in Durbanville, Cape Town, launched on October 1 and went big with their R10 menu on social media - now that’s great marketing. The menu includes pastries and sandwiches, and even their freshly-queezed juice goes for R10 a pop.
