We are re-engineering access to resources in an economy barely growing while facing the scourge of corruption, writes Buntu Siwisa.Fees Must Fall is but symptomatic of the other rights-based struggles we have passed through and is indicative of many others yet to come.We are re-engineering access to resources, education and work opportunities - to capital, skills and opportunities for the majority of South Africans.We do so in an economy barely growing - with 65.3 percent of the unemployed being in that state for more than a year; 71 percent aged between 15 and 34; 44 percent having never worked before; and 51 percent of our labour force having not completed matric.We do so facing the scourge of corruption, threatening to reduce us, if unchecked, to a state akin to Nigeria. It is so denuded of its capacities that it is only capable of singing, and tweeting for two years and counting about its girl children abducted in the next province.And so the Fees Must Fall and others come to face the burden of an unyielding economy in one corner. In the other corner is a group of invisible big men milking the economy to no end.In the middle, the Pied Piper of Hamelin is demanding payment for services rendered - the costs, the utilities, increasing at rates substantially higher than the inflation rate. And the benevolent state is decrying drying coffers.With all these driven by the mood of intransigence and radicalism, as Sisonke Msimang would have it (Shutdown - On the Death of Compromise in South Africa), it is only a matter of time before our benevolent state begins to implode gradually. Benevolent states have imploded before so thoroughly at the hands of their open-ended benevolence; their over-ambitious social welfare systems broken from over-stretching.From implosion, the benevolent state turns on its citizens, wittingly or unwittingly eating them, as it polices an increasingly enraged citizenry incapable of understanding the limits of state benevolence under the weight of so many pressures.&#x201C;The labourer&#x2019;s appetite works for him; his hunger drives him on&#x201D; (Proverbs, 16: 26).King Solomon understood precisely the urgency of the politics of the belly. And the misfortune is that the stomach understands no technicalities of numbers and statistics in explaining the limits of state benevolence.It remembers no past state benevolence, nor the origins of state benevolence ideas in Nelson Mandela, OR Tambo or Robert Sobukwe. At whatever cost, it must be fed, now.Zimbabwe, once the par-excellence of a benevolent welfare state, imploded in our faces.By the late 1990s, Zimbabwe was riddled with steep decline in industrial and agricultural productivity, hyperinflation, the informalisation of labour, drought, high unemployment, political pressures for compensation from war veterans, and foreign military pressures.A string of protests ensued as the state was no longer capable of delivering adequately.The state had imploded, and the Zimbabwean political landscape came to this overly-policed and militarised state that we know of now.The ANC government is one of the few developmental states in the history of post-coloniality whose social welfare system is so well-thought of and thorough.The origins of these policies have a long, noble and rich legacy, drawn from the African Bill of Rights of 1923, the African Claims Document of 1946, the Freedom Charter of 1955, the 1986 Constitutional Charter and many others, all feeding into the constitution.These have all translated into a way of life for the majority of South Africans.The state hauls out a baby from its mother free of charge for the woman, in a state hospital that does not charge fees. That child, maintained through various social grants, goes through no-fee schools.He and she grow up receiving free medical services and free ARVs. And when he/she become adults, they receive free RDP houses.When she becomes an expectant mother, she goes back to that state hospital, requesting that the state haul out her baby free of charge for her.Another generation, born to state benevolence, comes forth.Perhaps there lies the nub of the error of our ways, in the over-ambition and open-endedness of our social welfare system.Perhaps we have erred, in some way, when we find into the loop of state benevolence a 1991-born free child, with two children of her own, expecting to be housed for free, and receive all the social welfare benefits.How did she get into this loop? Are we wrong to suggest she should not be in it?Do we have the gall and the audacity to tell her that she should not be in it, while we cannot explain to the middle class why they are taxed to death?Did we, perhaps, get the messaging wrong somehow?And how do you explain the limits of state benevolence in numbers and statistics, to her, the taxi queue marshal and the domestic worker?How do you explain the difficulties of the South African government in spending more than 0.75 percent of its GDP on tertiary education, if there are any, to Fees Must Fall?How do you explain the challenges of sourcing R8 billion or R45bn per year to cater for free tertiary education for every student in every higher education institution in the country?But pointless intransigence and radicalism can only continue at the risk of a state imploding, as the government faces many pressures, while licking its wounds from the many bites of corruption, and facing demands for payments of services from the pied piper.Beating the stone too many times will not make it gush more water, when we can talk, and &#x201C;stand close enough to breath one another&#x2019;s breath&#x201D; (Msimang) in addressing Fees Must Fall, others on their way, and avoid the implosion of our benevolent state.
