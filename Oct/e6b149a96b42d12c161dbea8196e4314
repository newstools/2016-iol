Beirut - Islamic State on Monday confirmed the death of its propaganda chief, whom the Pentagon said was killed in a US-led air strike in Syria's Raqqa province last month. An IS statement posted online paid tribute to Wa'il Adil Hasan Salman al-Fayad, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Furqan. The statement just referred to him by his alias. It did not say when, where or how he had died. Reuters
