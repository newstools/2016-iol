Orlando Pirates                   (0) 0 Kaizer Chiefs                       (0) 0 If you were visiting – sorry you had to see that. This historic encounter between two Soweto giants is supposed to be the benchmark for South African football, but it hasn’t been for some time. So, sorry you had to see that. Mamelodi Sundowns have, in recent times, set the standards for what domestic football should be all about. Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs – while usually a different specimen in other Absa Premiership matches that do not carry the magnitude that comes with this derby – simply offer a good decent little afternoon with friends at this beautiful Calabash, a venue that hosted the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands. These two big guns haven’t offered a lot as far as value for money over the past couple of seasons, so much so that in the build-up to this league encounter, the general feeling was that there would be no winner here. The fans deserved better. The tactics should have been better. The players – even in the scotching heat – should have been better. If there’s anything to take away from this, it was the fact that the crowd, although it wasn’t a sold out match, never disappoints. They cheered them on, whistled, sang and kept their eyes firmly fixed on the football throughout. It went all wrong during the warm-up sessions for Pirates, with coach Muhsin Ertugral forced to swap Luvuyo Memela for Riyaad Norodien just a few minutes before kick-off. Memela had been struggling with a stomach ailment earlier in the week and had to be rushed to a clinic on Wednesday afternoon. About 20 minutes prior to this Soweto Derby, the player made his way to the change rooms sobbing, covering his face with his t-shirt. Ertugral was frantic and soon had to call on Norodien, who did not have a bad game under the circumstances, but was replaced by Mahlatsi Makudubela in the 79th minute. The Pirates coach will point to the unexpected changes to his line-up for how his team performed. But what was his opposite number Steve Komphela’s excuse? Chiefs came into this match on a high following five successive wins in the league and last week’s Telkom Knockout opening cup tie against Maritzburg United at this venue. They were also top of the Premier League standings until late last night when Maritzburg held Golden Arrows to a 2-2 draw in the Kwazulu-Natal derby played at the Harry Gwala Stadium. Amakhosi were really set-up to build their momentum by claiming a big scalp here, but they could only manage to share the spoils. The manner in which these two sides gained a point apiece will not linger long in memory – unless this was your first ever Soweto Derby. We’ve all seen better, sorry. He might not come right out and say it, but Komphela will still be punching the air relieved that the unbeaten run continues and keeps the Glamour Boys in the driving seat thanks to a slightly superior goal difference to that of Arrows. Chiefs host rookies Baroka FC on Wednesday in Durban and will look to that match to bounce back to being winners and not sharing the pie. The Buccaneers have a tougher assignment on Tuesday, hence they perhaps needed the win here more than their bitter rivals. Pirates travel to Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit to play SuperSport Untied – that could be a banana skin. This Soweto Derby never really got going.
