President Jacob Zuma has given notice of his intention to suspend Deputy National Directors of Public Prosecutions, Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi from office, pending an enquiry into their fitness to hold office.This comes in the wake of the pair asking the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, for leave to appeal against the damning findings against them that they were not fit and proper persons to hold the office of an advocate.The court at the time ordered that both be struck from the roll of advocates.DA files papers for Jiba inquiryZuma s office on Tuesday afternoon announced that the President has requested the two advocates to provide him with reasons as to why they cannot be suspended, pending the outcome of the enquiry into their fitness to hold office.His office said that after the hearing, Zuma will decide as to whether to suspend them or not. Their names were removed from the roll of advocates following an application by the General Council of the Bar.Judge Francis Legodi, in a lengthy judgement concurred by Judge Wendy Hughes, did not mince his words when he found the pair not to be worthy of serving the advocates profession any longer.Jiba was called an un-repenting, dishonest person, while Mrwebi was said to be a liar and someone who seems to have forgotten about the oath which he took when he was admitted as an advocate. The pair recently filed papers with the court, in which they are asking for leave to appeal. They stated a number of reasons for claiming the judge erred when he came to these findings and said they were not deserving of the harsh treatment they got from the court. zelda.venter@inl.co.zaIndependent Media
