Victoria, Seychelles - Alphonse Island in Seychelles will make its debut into the luxury travel sector, offering guests unique experiences that can't be found anywhere else in Seychelles. The island, known as one of the best fly fishing destinations in the world, has made significant modifications to appeal to the lucrative luxury travel market. All twenty-one Beach Bungalows and five spacious Beach Suites on the island have been extensively refurbished to create a more 'barefoot luxury' feel with new colours and new furnishings. Also the beach bar and the restaurant have been entirely revamped. However, the true luxury of the island lies in the unique experiences it has to offer. The Alphonse Group of Islands comprising St Francois, Bijoutier and Alphonse islands, are considered the most remote, pristine and unspoilt group of islands in the Seychelles. Travellers will be able to embark on nature conservation walks to the uninhabited islands of Bijoutier and St Francois. They'll be able to have a unique experience by overnighting on A'Manni our Cat in the St Francoise lagoon, or discover the expansive flats surrounding the Alphonse atolls as well as participate in conservation-related activities. The newly opened dive centre will allow travellers to explore the pristine underwater world of the region through snorkelling trips and diving excursions. “We are offering something exceptional. In today's travel industry, people want more than a private plunge pool and butler. They want to explore, discover and create memories that will last a lifetime and that's exactly what Alphonse Island offers,” says Keith Rose Innes, Managing Director of Alphonse Island. Alphonse Island taps into the 'Real Seychelles' where everything is still raw, flawless and untouched, says also Amanda Lang, Marketing Manager Alphonse Island.  “Alphonse Island is not just another Island resort; it is a destination where the real luxury lies in the experience.” Adapted from a press release for IOL
