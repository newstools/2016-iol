The 64-year-old star insists her relationship with her husband of 34 years - who she split from briefly in May after he had an affair with celebrity hairstylist Michelle Pugh - is “good” and the pair are in a settled marriage again. She said: “Everything is good. Everything's on track. “Listen, I'm blessed, I have a blessed life, I'm very lucky to be doing what I do. “You know what, my hubby as I call him a dirty dog, he might be a dirty dog, but he's my dirty dog. I've known him since I was 18 and I'm 64 can you believe it?” The 'X Factor' judge - who has kids Aimee, 33, Kelly, 31 and Jack, 30 with Ozzy - admitted her and the Black Sabbath frontman's recent rough patch has helped her to appreciate life and how short it is. Speaking on 'Good Morning Britain', she added: “I have come through and I'm definitely out the other side. It makes you realise how short your life is, how precious your love is and your family.” The couple briefly went their separate ways in May after Ozzy cheated and later revealed he had been dealing with sex addiction for six years. Sharon took a month off 'The Talk' to recover. Ozzy, 67, surprised Sharon with a bunch of flowers on her 64th birthday earlier this month when he turned up at 'The Talk' studios unbeknown to her. He greeted her with the words “happy birthday, darling” before presenting her with the floral gift and giving her an on-screen kiss. Bang Showbiz
