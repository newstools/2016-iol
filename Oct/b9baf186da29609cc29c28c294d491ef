Aherlow, Ireland - US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday he had not been contacted by the FBI about new investigative steps being taken related to Hillary Clinton&apos;s use of a private email server.&#x201C;No, I haven&apos;t been notified of anything, no, I haven&apos;t been requested of anything, no, I&apos;m not aware of the department being requested, and I have no further comment to make,&#x201D; Kerry told a news conference in Ireland where he is being awarded a peace prize.&#x201C;As an American citizen and former nominee of the party, there is a lot I&apos;d like to say about what is going on, but I can&apos;t and I am just going to remain out of this,&#x201D; he added.
