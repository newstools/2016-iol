Durban - A growing climate of fear is taking South Africa on a downward path.That was the message from Reverend Frank Chikane, who gave the keynote address at the 40th Anniversary Gala Dinner of the Diakonia Council of Churches held at Greyville in Durban on Friday night. Chikane, an ANC stalwart and one of the old guard of the 106 veterans who have recently criticised the current party leadership, sounded a warning for the 2019 national elections. He highlighted an unprecedented level of fear from people providing information relating to the alleged state capture, as well as councillors being killed in recent local elections. I can t believe that 20 people died during elections for being a councillor, that just being a councillor is a matter or life or death. Are people so fearful they will kill for a position? We have also asked for information about state capture, but people are scared they are going to be killed. We are in a condition that is very risky for this country. I shudder to think of 2019, said Chikane. He also raised the #FeesMustFall movement issue, saying students demands have brought in a stark reality that 22 years after freedom students feel defined by how poor their parents are .He said the ANC s vision in 1994 was for an equitable society.Asking churches to work together at ward level, Chikane highlighted the work done by the Diakonia Council since 1976, when churches combined forces to fight against apartheid and social injustice. The dinner was a gathering of many former anti-apartheid activists from church, business and political spheres and civic organisations.Independent on Saturday
