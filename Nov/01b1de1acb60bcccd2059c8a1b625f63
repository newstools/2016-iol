Cape Town - Following the court-ordered release of the public protector&#x2019;s report into state capture, MPs will today find themselves in familiar territory - another motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Last week opposition parties filed the motion for the vote of no confidence, and because the Speakers Office had lost a previous Constitutional Court challenge, Baleka Mbete had no choice but to table the motion for Thursday afternoon.Since 2010 there have been four previous no confidence motions filed against Zuma, and each time the ANC&#x2019;s sizable majority of 249 MPs shielded the party president from serious consequences - like his removal from office.The latest scandal to hit Zuma is the public protector&#x2019;s report into state capture which details, without pointing fingers, the role of the Gupta family&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes machinations to control the appointment of cabinet members and influence state-owned enterprises to their benefit.ANC parliamentary caucus spokesman Moloto Mothapo described Thursday&#x2019;s vote as a &#x201C;frivolous motion&#x201D;.&#x201C;It is not based on any substance, in terms of the Constitution any party can raise a motion of no confidence, you don&#x2019;t need to back it up with any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the president.&#x201C;Anyone can just wake up one day and say that they want a motion of no confidence, and the Speaker in terms of the Constitutional Court judgment of Sisulu vs Mazibuko is required to table such a motion, if and when it is made,&#x201D; said Mothapo.He said the Constitutional Court judgment had opened the floodgates of abuse, was a waste of time and undermined the voters of South Africa.DA leader Mmusi Maimane&#x2019;s spokesman Mabine Seabe says the motion of no confidence came at a significant time for South Africa.He said the stagnant economy, which was being mismanaged, the State of Capture report and calls from within the ANC for Zuma to step down had necessitated the motion of no confidence.Unlike other democracies, South Africa does not have a law of impeachment, and the motion of no confidence is the only mechanism parties represented in Parliament have to remove the sitting head of state.
