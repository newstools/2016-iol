London - A serial killer chef convicted of killing four young men he met on gay dating sites, including popular app Grindr, was told Friday that he would die in prison.Stephen Port, 41, from east London, spiked his victims' drinks with fatal amounts of the drug GHB so he could rape them while they were unconscious at his home.He was handed a whole life sentence at London's Old Bailey court after being found guilty on Wednesday of murdering four men between the ages of 21 and 25, and drugging and sexually assaulting seven other victims.Relatives of the victims cheered and clapped as the judge, Peter Openshaw, told Port he would never be released.One woman in the public gallery of the Old Bailey courtroom called Port a scumbag , the Press Association reported.Port lied to police, disposed of his victims' mobile phones and even planted a fake suicide note on one of the corpses in a bid to throw police off his scent.The Metropolitan Police are currently being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for how they handled the investigation into the four deaths, amid claims they missed opportunities to catch Port sooner.SAPA-dpa
