Durban - A mother has told of the horror of seeing an X-ray machine fall on her baby, breaking the 11-month-old girl&#x2019;s leg.Slindile Njapha, 25, said she had taken her daughter, Samkelisiwe, to uMlazi&#x2019;s Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital to have an X-ray after she fell off a sofa at their home in Nkangala, near Adams College.&#x201C;I noticed that she had a swollen knee and took her to hospital,&#x2019; Njapha said.When she arrived at the hospital, early this month, Samkelisiwe was taken to the X-ray department. Njapha, who was beside her daughter when the X-rays were being done, said the first two scans of the leg went off without a hitch.However, while a third scan was being done the machine fell. &#x201C;The corner of the machine fell on her leg and it broke her leg in two. It even bounced off her leg from the strong force of it,&#x2019; Njapha said.It was the same leg hurt in the sofa fall.Njapha said: &#x201C;I screamed and became hysterical... I could feel my child&#x2019;s pain. She was also screaming, but in agony.&#x2019;Samkelisiwe was taken to the emergency ward and spent a week in hospital.Njapha later discovered that X-rays showed the first incident had not seriously injured Samkelisiwe&#x2019;s leg. The falling machine also injured her baby&#x2019;s ankle.Her leg is now in a cast and the wound has to be dressed regularly.&#x201C;What if the child died there?...Taking legal action is something that I have to do,&#x2019; Njapha said.The child was born at the hospital.The IFP&#x2019;s spokeswoman on Health, Ncamisile Nkwanyana, said: &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t understand why machines are not being repaired or properly maintained.&#x201C;What has happened at Prince Mshiyeni Hospital is a wake-up call for the MEC of Health and his officials.&#x201C;We are concerned about the state of the equipment being used at this hospital, especially the old ones,&#x2019; she said.&#x201C;It is frightening to contemplate what will happen when the other equipment stops working or is damaged...,&#x201D; Nkwanyana said.&#x201C;Over the years, there has been a sharp deterioration in health care at hospitals and clinics in KZN, marked by shortages of medicines, collapsing infrastructure, broken equipment and inadequate provision of staff. This has led to a situation in which the access to health care services and patients&#x2019; dignity is compromised on a daily basis,&#x201D; she said.Department of Health spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said: &#x201C;Without prejudice, the department can confirm the isolated regrettable alleged adverse incident involving one of its patients which happened at one of its health facilities.&#x201C;Following the alleged incident, a patient received due medical care. Hospital management also met the patient&#x2019;s mother to explain what allegedly transpired and to provide her with counselling,&#x201D; Mkhwanazi said.
