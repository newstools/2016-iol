Carrie Fisher had an "intense" three-month affair with Harrison Ford. The actress was just 19-years-old in 1976 when she had a 12-week dalliance with her 'Star Wars' co-star - who was married to Mary Marquardt at the time. She told People magazine: "It was so intense. It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend." The co-stars spent their first night together after a birthday party for director George Lucas, Fisher reveals in her book The Princess Diarist. She added: "I looked over at Harrison. A heroâ€™s face - a few strands of hair fell over his noble, slightly furrowed brow. "How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me? ... I was so inexperienced, but I trusted something about him. He was kind." The actress decided to open up after she stumbled on journals she kept while filming on location in London, according to the publication. The 60-year-old star later took to Twitter to insist she wouldn't be going into any more details about what happened. She wrote on the microblogging site: "I couldnt get twitter working on my new phone so I've been away during this out of context book excerpt time ... I would never talk about how someone was in any furniture - chair, bed, coffee table or otherwise." Carrie previously opened up about the chemistry between the pair. She shared: "I actually recently found my diaries from this [time] ... It had some memories in it ... I wonder it too, so when I found the journals I looked. I haven't looked all the way through it but I must say it seemed to be trending in that direction ... "Well when I went on the film I really thought, I saw him and he looked like a movie star. I met him in LA and read with him and stuff and was too nervous to see him. So when we got on the set I saw him and he was sitting in the Millennium Falcon ... and I thought he looked like one of those movie stars which was not how Mark [Hamill] and I appeared."  Bang Showbiz
