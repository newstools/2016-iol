Cape Town - fastjet, the low-cost pan-African airline, has introduced FlexiTrip, a flight bundle solution that allows frequent flyers to purchase 10 one-way flights at a fixed price inclusive of taxes and fees. The FlexiTrip solution provides flexibility as flights can be booked up to six hours before departure time and is valid for travel within a year of purchase, subject to flight availability. The 10 flights can be used by any of the three passengers nominated at the time of making the booking, allowing passengers the choice of who can benefit from the bundle flights. “fastjet has responded to the needs of its frequent fliers, many who have last-minute business meeting requests or spontaneously want to visit family and friends throughout the year,” says Nico Bezuidenhout, CEO of fastjet. FlexiTrip provides frequent travellers with affordability and savings benefits too as the 10 flights are paid for in advance at a fixed price, which will not fluctuate close to departure date. “This added service offering makes it possible for our frequent flyers to plan regular trips more efficiently and also budget better due to the fixed ticket price,” says Bezuidenhout. FlexiTrip options are available for domestic flights within Tanzania on all routes between Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro, Mwanza, Mbeya and Zanzibar at a cost of R15 000 and within Zimbabwe between Harare and Victoria Falls for R11 250, both inclusive of taxes and fees. The flight bundle solution is also available on international flights on fastjet’s routes between Harare and Johannesburg, and Victoria Falls and Johannesburg at a cost of R22 500, inclusive of two free check-in bags per flight and taxes and fees. * Book the FlexiTrip package and 10 individual flights via the fastjet Call Centre on + +27 11 722 0226.
