Pretoria &#x2013; Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema led his party supporters to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Wednesday &#x201C;to force&#x201D; Jacob Zuma to resign.Within minutes of marchers&#x2019;arrival at the Union Buildings, chaos erupted as police fired rubber bullets at protesters.In an &#x201C;I told you so speech&#x201D; following a high court ruling earlier on Wednesday that the so-called state capture report by the Public Protector be released by 5pm, Malema told the supporters at Church Square: &#x201C;Everything that the EFF fought for has been granted by the court. I haven&#x2019;t checked my email yet, but am sure the Public Protector report has landed in my email.&#x201D; CIC @Julius_S_Malema negotiating with police to open the gate into the Union Building Gardens #EFFMarch #DayOfAction pic.twitter.com/8aunwp8BQu &#x2014; EFF Official Account (@EFFSouthAfrica) November 2, 2016CIC @Julius_S_Malema negotiating with police to open the gate into the Union Building Gardens #EFFMarch #DayOfAction pic.twitter.com/8aunwp8BQu Outside of the Union Buildings.
