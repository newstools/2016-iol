Pretoria Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema led his party supporters to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Wednesday to force Jacob Zuma to resign.Within minutes of marchers arrival at the Union Buildings, chaos erupted as police fired rubber bullets at protesters.In an I told you so speech following a high court ruling earlier on Wednesday that the so-called state capture report by the Public Protector be released by 5pm, Malema told the supporters at Church Square: Everything that the EFF fought for has been granted by the court. I haven t checked my email yet, but am sure the Public Protector report has landed in my email.

Don t be afraid, we will not stop until we get land. We are fighting Zuma because he undermines African leadership and projecting black people as being incapable to run this country.
