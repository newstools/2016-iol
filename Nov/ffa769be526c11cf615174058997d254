Johannesburg &#x2013; Gauteng is considering declaring &#x201C;disaster areas&#x201D; after recent storms left a number of people dead &#x2013; including a small child and a six-month pregnant woman &#x2013; as well as damage to many cars and houses.Three-year-old Everite Chauke was swept away by the rushing Jukskei river in Alexandra last week on Wednesday and she is still missing. The body of a six-month pregnant woman whose car was swept away on the same day has been recovered.&#x201C;Over the past few days, large parts of our province, including the OR Tambo International Airport, experienced severe rain storms, which in some instances caused extensive damage to public infrastructure, homes and cars,&#x201D; said the province in a statement issued by its Department of Roads and Transport on Tuesday.The department said sadly a number of lives, including that of a little child, have been lost.&#x201C;The Gauteng Provincial Government expresses its sincerest condolences to the families and friends of the deceased,&#x201D; said the department.&#x201C;Premier David Makhura is seriously considering declaring some affected parts of Gauteng as disaster areas so that government can tap into all available resources to assist those adversely affected by the floods.&#x201D;The department said through tireless efforts by the departments of Human Settlements, Community Safety, Health, Social Development and local municipalities, displaced residents were being temporarily accommodated in churches and community centres.Government departments and emergency services as well as charitable and welfare organisations are providing immediate relief to residents.&#x201C;Moving forward, government will ensure that people who are informally settled along river banks are moved to formal areas to prevent the risks associated with such living patterns,&#x201D; said the provincial department of transport.&#x201C;Residents living next to rivers and streams are urged to evacuate to a safer place and those living in low lying areas must avoid crossing flooded bridges and rivers.&#x201C;Motorists and pedestrians should take extra care on our roads and avoid crossing through flooded routes.&#x201D;The province said it would like to thank disaster management teams as well as rescue services linked to the private sector, who have been doing &#x201C;a great job in assisting residents in distress&#x201D;.The department added: &#x201C;In particular, we would like to acknowledge the bravery and heroism of ordinary civilians, who reached out to their compatriots in their moments of need on the first days of the flash floods. We sincerely thank you for your courage and caring attitude&#x201D;. African News Agency IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
