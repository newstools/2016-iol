Johannesburg - Following weeks of rain and cooler weather, Gauteng residents have been urged to brace themselves for hot and dry weather this week.The SA Weather Service has issued a watch for heatwave conditions from Wednesday across the province with minimal to no rain predicted. Temperatures today (Monday) are expected to reach between 29 and 33 degrees, said forecaster for the SA Weather Service Bransby Bulo . Tomorrow temperatures will move into the lower and mid thirties and from Wednesday they re expected to remain in the mid-thirties until the weekend. We are considering issuing a heat wave warning, we will continue to monitor, he said.Bulo said the hot and dry weather was caused by a high pressure system moving into the province from the North West. Instead of going up and forming clouds, you have subsiding air which goes down and as it comes down it warms up. This results in clear conditions and hot temperatures, he explained.Bulo said that this type of weather could also bring with it a fire danger because of the dry conditions.High temperatures and minimal rain is expected over the North West Province and Limpopo.However, he added that wetter and cooler weather was forecast for KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.On Sunday night there were reports of significant damage in parts of Ermelo in Mpumalanga following heavy rains and flooding.
