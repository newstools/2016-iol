The seventh annual ‘Motswako’ hip hop festival had all the right elements, the heat, the rain and the music. Police got in the way of fans witnessing a “we have kissed and made up” moment between HHP and Cassper Nyovest. A few minutes before the two rappers were to share the stage, police announced that it was “shut down” time. The show - which was supposed to begin at 3pm - ran late, meaning that the organisers' strategy of saving the best for last backfired. Fans waited with baited breath for Cassper’s return on the stage. He made it into the line-up after missing out on the show in 2015. Hip-hop fanatics pitched up in their numbers to enjoy one of the most anticipated annual hip hop events on the calendar. Maftown Heights - which features most of the popular “Motswako” rappers, as well as friends of “Motswako”. Khuli Chana, HHP, Tuks, JR, Fifi Cooper, Mo Molemi and Towdee Mac were among those who kept the crowd happy. The set up allowed for freedom of movement and sponsor KFC hosted a stand - which became all too important at 1am - and various other sponsors like Liberado, Absolute, Play energy drink and Vodacom #NXTLVL were present as well. Some of the performers that stood out include Khuli Chana (whose performance was packed with energy), Tuks (who left the crowd reeling from nostalgia), K.O and AKA. The Ambitious Records crew definitely rocked the stage. As predicted, the rain did not stay away, initially drizzling slowly before it started pouring. But that did not deter the fans that were clearly there to have a good time. Some covered themselves using plastic bags and others with umbrellas, while some just took it as an opportunity to cool down. The MCs - Yfm's DJ Sabby and actor SK Khoza (who took over in the spur of the moment when Nomuzi Mabena left) - kept the crowed hyped up as the rain poured, even getting wet themselves. “All for the love of hip-hop,” they made the crowd chant, and the music continued blasting.
