Johannesburg - An Ekurhuleni mother and her three young children survived a harrowing hijacking ordeal at the weekend.But although they managed to escape unscathed, they have been left traumatised, after their possessions and vehicle were stolen at gunpoint.Police spokeswoman Captain Nomsa Sekele said that at around 2pm on Saturday afternoon, the family were travelling from Mackenzie Park to Farrarmere in Benoni. As the woman was trying to park her BMW outside a house in the area, she spotted four men travelling in a Hyundai behind her. Two of the men got out of the car and approached the woman and her children, said Seleke.She said the pair, who were armed with handguns, knocked on the driver's window and ordered the woman and her children to get out of car. The alleged thieves also instructed the family, at gunpoint, to not scream or cause a scene which would alert attention to them.Seleke said the men then stole the woman's jewellery and got inside her vehicle before fleeing the scene. She said the woman reported the theft and hijacking to the police and with the help of a tracking device installed inside the BMW, they managed to recover the car in Alexandra later on Saturday. The car was left in Alexandra and it is believed that the men fled on foot. Seleke said the woman and her children were not injured during the hijacking. But those behind the incident are still at large. No arrests have been made but the matter is under investigation, she said.Seleke added that as the suspects are still at large, police are urging anyone with information on their whereabouts to report it.[email&#160;protected]@Karishma_DipaTHE STAR
