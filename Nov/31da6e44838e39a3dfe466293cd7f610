The world's shortest flight, a tiny hop between two remote British islands, celebrated on Monday taking its millionth passenger on the route. The 1.7-mile (2.7-kilometre) flight between Westray and Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands, off mainland Scotland's northeast coast, holds the Guinness World Record as the shortest scheduled service. The flight, in an eight-seater Britten Norman Islander aircraft, officially takes two minutes but with favourable winds it can be done in 47 seconds. It is part of a service route that leaves Orkney's main town Kirkwall and stops off around the archipelago. Scottish regional airline Loganair has operated the route since 1967 and on Monday honoured veteran passenger Anne Rendall, presenting her with a bouquet of flowers. The Royal Bank of Scotland flying banker has flown more than 10,000 trips on the service, visiting island communities and tending to their banking requirements. "The route is a jewel in our network and known across the world," said Loganair's managing director Jonathan Hinkles. "However, despite its fame, it's an essential life-line service for the people of Orkney, connecting the individual islands via a convenient air link. "It's used by teachers, doctors, policemen and school pupils, helping them to go about their daily routines with ease and simplicity." AFP
