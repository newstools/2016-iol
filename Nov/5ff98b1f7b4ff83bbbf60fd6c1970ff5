Kim Kardashian West wants to "explore" surrogacy. The 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star has previously vowed not to bear more children after suffering complications while pregnant with daughter North, now three, and Saint, 10 months, but it seems she and husband Kanye West are looking at alternative ways to expand their family further. In a clip from next week's episode of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians', Kim told her shocked-looking family: "So I've come to the conclusion that I just want to explore surrogacy." The 36-year-old beauty admitted shortly after Saint was born that her 39-year-old rapper spouse was already talking about wanting a third baby - but she had refused. She said: "I said no way. I was so set on my two kids and how happy I was with my life the way that it is, but Kanye has been mentioning it every single day for the past 10 days. I'm like why is he doing this to me?!" And it is no surprise that Kim isn't keen on carrying another child as she really struggled with her two pregnancies. She explained previously: "With the issues I had last time, my risk of having pre-eclampsia and placenta accreta are increased and there's not a whole lot I can do to prevent it, so my anxiety is a little high leading up to my delivery.   "In a very rare case, I might need a hysterectomy after delivery if my condition is severe enough, but luckily my doctor doesn't think this will happen. So as time goes on, I am stressing out less and trying to go with the flow ... "We induced my labour and I had North soon after. Right after delivery, the placenta usually then comes out. Mine did not. My placenta stayed attached inside my uterus, which is a condition called placenta accreta ... "My doctor had to stick his entire arm in me and detach the placenta with his hand, scraping it away from my uterus with his fingernails. How disgusting and painful! (sic)"    Bang Showbiz
