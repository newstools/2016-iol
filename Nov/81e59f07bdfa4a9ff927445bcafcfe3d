Johannesburg - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has noted with serious concern the untimely resignation of Eskom CEO Brian Molefe on Friday, the union said. “There is no doubt that Eskom was beginning to stabilise its power supply under his leadership,” NUM general secretary David Sipunzi said on Saturday. “The NUM believes it was premature for him to resign as we expected him to assist the [still to be appointed] commission of inquiry in a number of allegations that have been levelled personally against him and Eskom as an entity in the [public protector's] state capture report. Brian Molefe should have waited for the commission of inquiry to complete its work,” he said. In her report, former public protector Thuli Madonsela made several determinations, including that President Jacob Zuma appoint within 30 days a commission of inquiry headed by a judge solely selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. “The NUM is highly disappointed that again Eskom is in leadership crisis within such a very short space of time. We will await full disclosure regarding reasons for his resignation and will thereafter comment further,” Sipunzi said. African News Agency
