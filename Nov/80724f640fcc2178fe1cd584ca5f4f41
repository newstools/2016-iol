Rocco Ritchie says he's “so glad” he no longer lives with his mum Madonna. The 16-year-old son of Madonna and Guy Ritchie has taken to Instagram in a now-deleted post that seemingly slams his 58-year-old mother for being embarrassing. Rocco took to the picture sharing website to post a video of his family - including Madonna and his adopted siblings David, 11, and Mercy, 10 - taking part in the Mannequin Challenge which requires the participants to stay completely still. Madonna was filmed with food hanging out of her mouth as she froze mid meal. The video footage was captioned: “So glad I don't live here anymore.” When fans of the Like A Virgin singer came to her defence to tell the teenager it was just a bit of fun, Rocco simply replied with a series of laughing emojis. According to The Sun, Rocco also reportedly blocked a number of his mother's fans on the site, preventing them from accessing his page. Rocco currently lives in London with his father, where he was arrested last week for possession of marijuana. A source said at the time of his arrest: “Rocco has become a well-known figure in the neighbourhood and not for the right reasons. He's been repeatedly seen acting suspiciously. “This incident was the final straw. Local residents are fed up with him acting in this manner and called the police.” According to sources, Rocco was sat on a wall with a friend when police approached them and the officials noticed traces of cannabis on his clothes. A Scotland Yard spokesperson said: “A 16-year-old has been arrested for possession of cannabis. He was bailed and dealt with by Camden Borough's Youth Offending Team.” A few days after her son's arrest, Madonna released a statement asking for “privacy” whilst the matter is dealt with. She said: “I love my son very much. I will do whatever I can to give him the support that he needs, and I ask that you respect our privacy at this time.” Bang Showbiz
