Pretoria - A couple who for two years endured a stream of abusive online messages and fake Facebook accounts opened in their names have had enough and now turned to court for help stop the trolls.The last straw was when pictures of their two young daughters, aged 7 and 3, dressed in swimming gear, were posted on the fake accounts. The parties are not named, as children are involved. The applicants, only identified as Mrs and Mr T, this week turned to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to obtain an urgent interdict against a couple, identified as Mrs and Mr S, of Monument Park in Pretoria.Their real names have been withheld to protect the privacy of their children.An extra-marital affair a few years ago between Mr T and Mrs S apparently sparked the stream of social media messages and fake accounts.It is claimed by the applicants that while they were able to put the affair behind them and continue with their lives, Mr S especially is behind the vindictive messages.The applicants recently moved to Namibia and said all their family and friends who remained behind in South Africa and who are friends with them on Facebook viewed the Facebook messages. This, they said, was extremely humiliating and offensive.Unbeknown to Mrs T at the time, her husband in December 2014, began receiving e-mails from random gmail accounts in which he was threatened that his relationship with Mrs S would be revealed.Mrs T also started receiving random text messages in which she was asked whether she knew what her husband was up to.Mrs T said she had no idea at the time that her husband had an affair and she only became aware of it when Mrs S eventually, after months, phoned her and told her about it. Her husband confessed and although it was a difficult time, they worked through it.But soon afterwards the harassment started, when the first fake Facebook account was opened, with the applicants pictures and particulars on it, followed by what the applicants described to court as horrifying comments . Subsequent to this, various other fake social media accounts, including Instagram accounts, appeared in their names. Mrs T said she managed to delete some of the accounts herself.In some of the accounts derogatory and even sexual remarks are made about her fat ass which would have difficulty in assuming certain sexual positions, Mrs T said, while in others her husband is referred to as the pig .In another false posting, the person purporting to be her husband boasted about his affairs and about his love for other women .The applicants said they know the respondents are behind this, especially Mr S, as it was stated in one of the posts that Bra s don t f* each other s wives. For the last two years there have been grave infringements on our rights, Mrs T said, adding that they now had had enough.The applicants asked the court to interdict the respondents from harassing them and stopping them from creating false Facebook and other social medial profiles in their (the applicants) names. They also want the respondents to be stopped from posting pictures of their (the applicants') children on any social media platforms.The postings on social media have been going on for about two years. The applicant couple stated in court papers that they have endured it for all this time, but the last straw was when pictures of their children a month ago appeared on these fake accounts. I was completely horrified that the respondents are now bringing two innocent children into this and I fear to what further extent they will go. At the very least, my children are in urgent need of protection from the exploitation of their images by the respondents in their vendetta against us, Mrs T told the court.The matter was removed from the urgent roll this week and it is expected to be re-enrolled next week, so as to give the respondents the opportunity to answer to the allegations levelled against them.[email&#160;protected]Pretoria News
