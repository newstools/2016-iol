Johannesburg - The South African National Editors&apos; Forum (Sanef) had condemned the harassment of a University of Johannesburg journalism student by police officers who visited him in the dead of night this week to confiscate his electronic equipment.Sanef said in a statement that second year student Magnificent Ndebele, 20, witnessed a confrontation between students and private security officials at a student accommodation facility earlier this month, when student Kelvin Baloyi was shot dead at point-blank range.Ndebele took photographs during the incident. Sanef said two police officers visited Ndebele between 1am and 2am on Thursday at his university residence and without any warrant confiscated his equipment, including his cellphone and laptop, and they accused him of inciting violence and interfering with their investigation.They also warned him that his movements were being watched. &#x201C;We recently raised our concerns about this hostility and unlawful actions of police officers when we met acting national police commissioner Lt-Gen Johannes Khomotso Phahlane. It remains a deep concern that many police officers act in a manner that is contrary to the country&apos;s laws and Constitution. We view Ndebele&apos;s harassment in the broader context of increasing police hostility and intimidation towards journalists,&#x201D; Sanef said.Sanef deplored the &#x201C;blatant bullying&#x201D; and called for the immediate return of Ndebele&apos;s property.
