Johannesburg - South Africa's rand recovered on Thursday as riskier assets globally stabilised after posting sharp losses on Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US presidential election. By 06h40 GMT the rand traded mostly flat, edging 0.09 percent firmer to 13.4250 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 13.4375. On Wednesday, the unit recorded its largest single-session fall since Brexit in June, tumbling to 1-1/2 week low of 13.83/$ before short sellers bagged profits. SACCI s October business confidence index recovered from three-decade lows, but SA s central bank warned that weak growth and political risk still pose a downgrade risk. Domestic mining and manufacturing figures were due later in the session on Thursday. Stocks were set to open higher at 07h00 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange's Top-40 futures index up 1 percent.
