Pretoria - Despite the participation of some African National Congress (ANC) heavyweights and struggle stalwarts at #SaveSouthAfrica&#x2019;s assembly against &#x201C;state capture&#x201D; in Pretoria this week, the ruling party&#x2019;s Greater Tshwane region on Thursday heaped scorn on the multi-party campaign.&#x201C;The REC (regional executive committee) resolved not to be part of the march with counter-revolutionary forces masquerading as forces of changes, of the Save South Africa movement,&#x201D; Tshwane ANC deputy chairperson Mapiti Matsena told reporters at the conclusion of a three-day lekgotla.&#x201C;Our revolutionary consciousness would not allow us to march with the real capturers of the state &#x2013; chief executive officers of mining houses, banks and big corporates that continue to exploit the masses of our people through discrimination in the workplace. We couldn&#x2019;t have been part of #SaveSouthAfrica movement which has in it questionable elements that derail the progress of the national democratic revolution.&#x201D;#SaveSouthAfrica is a campaign made up of civil society groups, business and corporate leaders, prominent individuals and South Africans in general, calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down and an end to what it calls endemic corruption and nepotism linked to government and wealthy individuals.On Wednesday, #SaveSouth Africa&#x2019;s &#x201C;people&#x2019;s assembly&#x201D; in Pretoria was attended by ANC heavyweights including Gauteng chairman Paul Mashatile, former cabinet minister Barbara Hogan, and former ANC deputy secretary-general Cheryl Carolus.Mapiti however said the ANC was planning to protest if the &#x201C;flimsy&#x201D; charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were not withdrawn.&#x201C;We further wish to condemn the National Prosecuting Authority for rushing to charge Minister Gordhan, and those who were accused with him, without applying their legal minds and looking into the material facts at their disposal. It is in this light that we would have marched to the courts on November 2, as directed by the ANC provincial working committee,&#x201D; said Matsena.The #SaveSA march was meant to coincide with Gordhan&#x2019;s court appearance which was scheduled for November 2, before the charges were withdrawn. Opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters also led protests in Pretoria CBD on Wednesday. The protests left a trail a destruction as shops and other buildings were looted and vandalised.ANC Tshwane regional chairman Kgosientso Ramokgopa said Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga is shying away from taking action against the EFF, which Ramokgopa said was behind the mayhem.&#x201C;It is interesting to note that the executive mayor does not condemn the EFF conduct in the city explicitly because he wants to preserve his position. No one has won the city of Tshwane but he was ascended to that seat through negotiation and a coalition, primarily on the backing of the EFF,&#x201D; said Ramokgopa, who is also Msimanga&#x2019;s predecessor.&#x201C;We will be going to council insisting that those who are responsible for vandalism for private and public property must be brought to book. Those who have done it have an identity and that is the EFF in the main.&#x201D; African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
