Johannesburg - Justice Minister Michael Masutha on Tuesday officially opened the Limpopo High Court on behalf of President Jacob Zuma who left South Africa to attend the funeral of leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro in Havana, Cuba. Zuma was scheduled to officially open the court and unveil the plaque. The new court had been in operation since January, enabling people in Limpopo access to high court services and saving them long distance trips to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Beleaguered Zuma, who leads a deeply divided Cabinet team and ruling party, continued with his official duties after emerging from a bruising African National Congress National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, where several ministers threatened his party leadership by tabling a motion of no confidence in him. The meeting was extended to Monday to allow the 86 NEC members to air their views on the motion tabled by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom. However, Zuma and his supporters put up a fight to ensure that the motion does not succeed. The ANC is expected to brief the media on the outcome of the NEC meeting on Tuesday afternoon.
