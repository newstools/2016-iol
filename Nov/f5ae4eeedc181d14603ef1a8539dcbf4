Port Elizabeth - Christopher Panayiotou was &#x201C;not very emotional&#x201D; upon the discovery of his dead wife&#x2019;s body on the outskirts of Kwanobuhle, where she was allegedly murdered in April last year, a family friend told the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday.&#x201C;When I got there, I saw Chris was with Demitri and Demitri looked quite cut up about it, but Chris, I don&#x2019;t know if he was in shock, but he was not very emotional,&#x201D; said Pieter Bekker.Bekker testified in the murder trial of Panayiotou and his two co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko.Bekker told the court how he and his friends assisted in the search for the schoolteacher on April 21 and April 22 last year. He said that he suggested to police a reward be put up for information on Jayde&#x2019;s disappearance.Defence Advocate accused Bekker of being gratuitous in saying that Panayiotou lacked visible emotions when Jayde&#x2019;s body was found.&#x201C;Your comment, and I put it to you that you are being gratuitous, that Christopher did not look very emotional. What are you trying to convey, are you suggesting that he was not upset that his wife was missing?&#x201D; asked Price.&#x201C;It is my opinion and no, he didn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; Bekker replied.&#x201C;I put it to you that when Christopher saw his wife, he cried, his father cried and Derrick Inggs cried and they hugged each other,&#x201D; said Price.Meanwhile, Captain Stephanus De Bruin in his evidence told the court how he was investigating 28-year old Nenembe during August last year in a matter unrelated to Jayde&#x2019;s murder.The State claims that Nenembe assisted alleged hitman Sizwe Vumazonke to kidnap Jayde from outside her Stellen Glen Complex while she waited for a lift to work.De Bruin told the court how went looking for Nenembe in Kwazakhele but instead spoke to his father.At this point Advocate Peter Daubermann objected to hearsay evidence being led.&#x201C;I am going to ask for this hearsay evidence to be put onto the record, so that the State can show how proceedings led from there, to verify this information,&#x201D; said State Prosecutor Marius Stander.Judge Dayalin Chetty allowed the State to continue but Daubermann objected again.&#x201C;This is the first time that I am being made aware that this evidence will be led and I ask the matter to stand down so that I may prepare to state my case,&#x201D; said Daubermann.The case will resume on Friday.Police have previously confirmed that Nenembe has other pending cases against his name, including a case where an elderly woman was smothered to death with a towel.
