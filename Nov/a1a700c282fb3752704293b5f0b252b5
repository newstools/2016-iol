Cape Town - Richard Madden, the Scottish actor who played Robb Stark in the series Game of Thrones, has been having a great time in the dunes of southern Africa, driving a futuristic vehicle on the set of a new TV series. Madden has been filming scenes for the pilot of the new sci-fi series Strange New Things in the deserts of Namibia. On his official Twitter account, Madden posted that it “has been a blast shooting with an amazing team in South Africa and Namibia”. “Hoping to shoot a bunch more next year! Today I’ll be mostly driving the beast... I love my job.” Then, in another tweet, he said: “Spent the day rallying about the desert in a beast of a 4x4. Bloody brilliant.” Strange New Things is an upcoming sci-fi series co-produced by Amazon Studios and Left Bank Productions. Another tweet from Madden shows that Cape Town production company Moonlighting Films is also working on the series. The Observatory production company has been involved in some of the largest productions filming in southern Africa in recent years, including the adaption of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, the film Resident Evil: The Final Chapter and the fourth season of the spy drama series Homeland. The Strange New Things pilot, directed by Kevin Macdonald, is based on 2014’s successful science fiction novel The Book of Strange New Things by author Michel Faber. According to deadline.com, the adaptation of Faber’s book has Madden starring as Peter, a priest who is sent into space to help found a new colony. The series is set in the near future when “Earth is becoming unsustainable”. Madden will act opposite US actor Haley Joel Osment, who rose in fame in The Sixth Sense. Deadline.com reported that Osment will play Sy, “a man who used to grow large quantities of marijuana before being recruited to work on the new colony as chief botanist”.  jan.cronje@inl.co.za  Weekend Argus
