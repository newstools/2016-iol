Another features Kylie handing Tyga a painted ornament of the word "dad", made by the toddler. A video posted by Kylie Jenner Snapchats (@kylizzlesnapchats) on Nov 17, 2016 at 6:11pm PST Tyga says to his son in the video: "Aw thank you man! Gimme a high five, gimme a high five!" To which King Cairo instead goes in for a cuddle, before being picked up by his dad. Tyga then asks: "Did you paint this yourself?" And King Cairo says: "Yeah!" Tyga then tells him: "I like it." And Kylie spared no expense on the wide spread of food that was laid out for the 'Ayo' rapper, making sure to include some his favourite foods such as fried chicken, and two separate cakes. The rest of the night was spent playing around with Tyga's son - whom he shares from his previous relationship to Blac Chyna, who is now engaged to Kylie's half-brother Rob Kardashian - as one video captures the boy sat in a fabric tunnel toy, giggling and screaming as his dad comes to catch him. The news of the small family party comes after Kylie was noticeably absent from Tyga's celebrations last year as the pair had gone on a break a few days before he turned 26.
