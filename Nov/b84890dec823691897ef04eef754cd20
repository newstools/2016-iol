London - A British former soccer coach was charged on Tuesday with eight historical offences of sexual assault against a boy under the age of 14. The charges against Barry Bennell, 62, who was a talent spotter at Crewe Alexandra and a coach at Manchester City, relate to “non-recent” child sexual abuse, the state prosecution service said without giving details. The charges include indecent assault, inciting a boy to commit an act of gross indecency and assault with intent to commit buggery. Bennell was charged after prosecutors received a file of evidence from Cheshire Police, the force in charge of the area of northwest England where Crewe Alexandra are based. Reuters
