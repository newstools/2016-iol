Durban - An urgent meeting was convened at the Verulam police station to try to put an end to the attempted land invasion which turned violent on Tuesday.At least five farm workers were assaulted by an angry group, who on Monday morning had blocked the road to the farm and demanded the small-scale farmers at a Verulam farm, in the Ntokozweni area, north of Durban, leave the property.At least two of the five were taken to hospital where they were treated and released.A farmer said one of his employees, identified only as Samson, was shaken after being attacked.The farmer, who asked not to be named, said it was strange that after &#x201C;so many years&#x201D; living on the farm, people were suddenly turning against them.&#x201C;This is bizarre.&#x201C;It needs involvement from all the stakeholders,&#x201D; he said, adding that Samson recently joined his farm.But Yaga Govender, president of the Natal Sugarcane Growers Association, said police had to be brought in on Tuesday morning to control the situation.&#x201C;We thought everything had cooled down after Monday morning&#x2019;s road blockade, (but Tuesday) a group which comprised people not residing on the farm, attacked the employees on their way to work.&#x201C;Police intervened and an urgent meeting was held with us as farmers, induna (Mqoqi) Ngcobo, community representatives and the police. It was discovered that the perpetrators in the attack were outsiders,&#x201D; said Govender.The Daily News reported on Tuesday that some of the group that blockaded the road to the farm had claimed they had bought plots from Ngcobo.However, in the meeting Ngcobo denied this.&#x201C;He denied selling plots for between R450 and R500 to these people. It is obvious there is a criminal element in this. But the police are looking into the matter and the situation has calmed down now,&#x201D; said Govender.Attempts to get comment from Ngcobo were unsuccessful.Provincial police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the meeting. He said cases of public violence and assault had been opened and no arrests had been made yet. Daily News IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
