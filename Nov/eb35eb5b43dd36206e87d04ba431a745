Johannesburg - Joburg's crush of cyclists will descend on the city on Sunday for the Telkom 94.7 Cycle Challenge. The race, that this year celebrates 20 years and attracts 30 000 cyclists, starts and ends at Riversands Commercial Park, just off the R511 in Fourways. Certain roads will be closed on the day by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department, Johannesburg Roads Agency and the City of Joburg. See below for the full inside track on road closures and the best ways to navigate Jozi's roads. Roads will be closed for as a short a time as possible to ensure the safety of cyclists and the normalisation of traffic, once all the cyclists have passed.   Pictures: Supplied The Saturday Star
