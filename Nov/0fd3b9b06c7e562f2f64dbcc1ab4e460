Cape Town - Six DA city councillors are facing suspension for not toeing the party line by electing a subcouncil chairman that was allegedly not approved by the party.Grant Twigg was on Tuesday re-elected as Subcouncil 2 chairman for a third time, despite a party directive that Clive Justus be elected to the post.Twigg and five others were given until Wednesday night to provide reasons why they should not be suspended for allegedly bringing the party into disrepute.At the meeting, Ward 8 councillor Marian Nieuwoudt proposed Twigg as the subcouncil chairman and he received six votes.Justus abstained from voting, while another DA councillor was absent.Those facing possible suspension are Twigg, Nieuwoudt, Ward 111 councillor Brenda Hansen, Ward 102 councillor Carin Brynard and proportional representatives Siseko Mbandezi and Xoliswa Pakela-Mapasa.Subcouncil 2 comprises Scottsdene, Kraaifontein, Wallacedene, Brackenfell and parts of Kuils River.Twelve members make up the subcouncil - 8 DA, 3 ANC and one from the EFF.The ANC had proposed Simphiwe Nonkeyizana for the job and he received four votes.Twigg and Nieuwoudt confirmed on Wednesday they were facing suspension.Twigg said he believed he was the candidate approved by the party during earlier caucus meetings until he was allegedly informed by Justus on Friday he was in fact the candidate that had to be proposed and endorsed.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve chaired the subcouncil for two terms and I&#x2019;ve done so without any problems that I know of. It&#x2019;s one of the best-run subcouncils,&#x201D; he said.DA regional chairman and party whip in the city council Shaun August, who informed councillors of pending disciplinary action, said he was unavailable for comment. The party&apos;s federal executive chairman James Selfe said the executive was not required nor empowered to endorse subcouncil chairmen.The city caucus executive had the right to suspend a member pending an investigation, but an investigation would have to first be sanctioned by the federal executive.&#x201C;The federal executive will await the details of the prima facie alleged misconduct committed by the councillors,&#x201D; said Selfe.Justus was approved as the portfolio committee chairman on economy and environment at last month&apos;s council meeting. It is not common practice for councillors to serve as chairman of both a portfolio committee and a subcouncil.Justus did not return calls for comment.Nieuwoudt and Brynard were tight-lipped over why they voted for Twigg.Both seasoned councillors, Nieuwoudt has served on the mayco and was the portfolio committee chairwoman for human settlements earlier this year.Brynard recently led the portfolio committee on safety and security.Party insiders said Twigg enjoyed the backing of his colleagues because he was capable and well-known to the community.Justus is not a resident of the Subcouncil 2 area.Sources said Twigg was an outspoken member of the DA city caucus and his removal as a subcouncil nominee was a likely consequence of challenging authority.
