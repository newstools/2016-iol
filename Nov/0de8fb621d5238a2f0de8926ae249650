Durban - Former DA provincial leader Sizwe Mchunu on Monday announced that he had bowed out as the party s caucus leader in the provincial legislature.He said he would now focus on his spiritual and business journey. After the announcement, provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango congratulated MPL Francois Rodgers, who took up the position after he was elected unopposed.Mncwango was quick to knock Mchunu's announcement, saying none of the caucus members had nominated him for the position.Regarding Rodgers's elevation to caucus leader, Mncwango said: I am so excited about this development because he is capable of taking the party forward as we prepare for the 2019 elections. Mchunu wrote to the DA leadership on Monday informing them of his intention to stand down as the caucus leader. He said he would now pursue spiritual/psychological growth, business venture and would also pay more attention his two daughters Siphokazi and Siphesihle, and his fianc&eacute;e Slindile Mdluli, whom he would marry soon. This was the first time the DA in KZN elected its leader of the legislature, because previously a provincial leader would automatically lead the MPLs. I am so grateful for the relationships we have built, and it pleases me to stand down knowing that I have never quarrelled with any of you, said Mchunu.Mchunu had led the caucus since 2009. He said he would remain an MPL until the next general elections in 2019. I merely stepped down as the leader of the caucus. I have decided that I am not going to be available for election, he said.Mchunu, who said he had always been devoted to his church, said he would focus on healing my soul and my spirit . I will engage on the issues of motivating, and encourage other young people who are losing hope. The spiritual part relates to me as a person. I will devote more time on issues of getting closer to God and also understanding who I am as Sizwe, he said.The Mercury
