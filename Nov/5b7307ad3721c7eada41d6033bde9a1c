“Who can legitimately say that their life was changed by a Kardashian?” This is a question from one of the overweight women seeking help  from Khloe Kardashian on a new reality TV show. “You’re going to start to transform your body and you’re going to have this revenge on this life that you once had that you won’t even want anymore,” promises Khloe, as she takes a group of men and women on a journey to their “revenge body”. The 'Stronger Looks Better Naked' author has shared a sneak peek of the show on her Twitter account:   Khloe also announced: "Catch an exclusive preview special of the new series on November 23 at 9pm ET/PT on E!".   She added: "I have worked soooo hard on Revenge Body!! I can't wait for you guys to meet these amazing people! Their journeys are incredible! Proud!!" IOL
