THE IRONY behind the group Makifizolo is that, while they have been in the game for ages, their name means “newcomers”. This probably keeps them fresh and on their toes, as they never treat fame and success as a given. Yet the South African musical story is incomplete if it excludes them. As you will see in tomorrow’s show, “The Kaya FM Presents Live at the Bassline” (10 Henry Nxumalo Street, Newtown), the pair – Nhlanhla Nciza and Theo Kgosinkwe – know how to work a crowd. She is the sweetheart of the duo and concentrates on singing, while he’s a performer who incorporates intoxicating dance moves. Together, they form Mafikizolo, and they are far from novices. The band has travelled the world, with one of their highlights being a performance at the Wembley Stadium, where they played with Akon. If you are a regular at Bassline, you’ll know that the band hasn’t been at the venue for an incredible 11 years! So this is a big homecoming party that many people are looking forward to. Young fans might only know recent songs such as Khona, but true fans have been there since the days of Kwela Kwela and Emlanjeni. The only problem that the group will have is time, as they cannot possibly perform all the songs that made them well known. – Tonight Reporter •R150 at Webtickets.co.za, R180 at the door.
