Johannesburg - Four alleged drug dealers, aged between 31 and 58, have been arrested near Vredenburg after being found with Mandrax tablets valued at R7.5 million hidden in false compartments of a truck, police said on Tuesday. Spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the men were caught after an intelligence led operation by members of the Directorate For Priority Crime Investigation's South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB). Members swiftly reacted to information of a truck and a pilot vehicle along R45 allegedly transporting and escorting drugs. The resultant search of the vehicles uncovered over 771 000 units of Mandrax tablets valued at approximately R7.5 Million hidden in the false compartments of the truck, Ramovha said. The four suspects, from Gauteng, are expected to appear in the Vredenburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday facing charges relating to drug-dealing.African News Agency
