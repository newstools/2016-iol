Durban - After five months of planning, uMhlanga Tourism has finally announced the schedule for this year’s uMhlanga Summer Season, which gets under way next month. The programme will run from December 10 to 23, from 10am to 2pm daily, with every event being free, apart from the popular uMhlanga Trail Run. Durbanites and those descending on KZN’s festive capital would be treated to five events, including daily entertainment shows for kids, organisers said at the launch at The Oyster Box hotel. The Lizard Surf Championship and Hurricane Surf will be contested on December 10 and 11, with surfers from all over the country. Anne Wright, contest director, said there would be opportunities for all age and skills groups. “We will have from under-12s, to open, to masters divisions,” she said. The uMhlanga Trail Run will have 5km, 12km, and 18km events. The 5km race will be along the beach promenade, with the 18km extending as far as uMdloti beacon. Contestants in the men’s and women’s divisions stand a chance of to win R6 000. “When we started in 2010, we had 150 runners. We have about 500 this year,” said Vaughn Smit of Riverside Trail Run. Festival-goers will also be treated to Carols by Candlelight shows in Granada Square on December 15. While there will be no entrance fee, people are encouraged to bring a gift which will be distributed to underprivileged children by uMhlanga Rotary. Kids can look forward to daily four-hour beach activities from December 12 to 23, hosted by entertainers Kevin Ellis and Gareth Greaves, at the Millennium Stage on the beach. “It will take the strain off parents,” Ellis said.
