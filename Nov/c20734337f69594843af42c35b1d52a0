We're talking to you, Simon... Slim-fit shirts and blazers have been a staple in men's wardrobes for the past few years. However, they're not suited for everyone and all body types. Gerd Mueller-Thomkins from the German Fashion Institute says the wearer should be slender and fit to carry it off. If not, the clothing can get too tight and start hugging your torso. So, if you have a bit of a belly, you might want to avoid buying slim-fit pieces in the first place. Slim-fit means that the item of clothing is tailored in and lies close to the body. Modern and "shaped" fits are less tailored and tight-fitting. With "regular" and "classic" fits, the chest and waist are about the same width and are still tailored, but only slightly. "Comfort" fits refer to shirts that have a wider, more loose cut. DPA
