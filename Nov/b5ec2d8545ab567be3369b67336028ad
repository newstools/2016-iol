Just how does the Smurf village stay so heavily populated with only one Smurfette around? Perhaps the cute blue gang doesnâ€™t have the time to ponder such mysteries, what with constantly having to escape the clutches of the evil Gargamel. That said, with the boys going about their normal business, Smurfette is pondering her purpose in the village. When she chances upon a mysterious map, she sets off on an adventure through the Forbidden Forest, with her friends naturally in tow. What they discover is the biggest secret in the history of Smurfdom. Smurfs: The Lost Village is an animated 3D film set for release next year. It stars Demi Lovato as the voice of Smurfette, Magic Mike star Joe Manganiello as Hefty Smurf and Rainn Wilson as Gargamel.
