Cape Town - Cricket South Africa announced late on Monday that Proteas captain Faf du Plessis' ICC hearing into allegations of ball-tampering will take place on Tuesday afternoon Australian time. Last week the ICC charged Du Plessis for an alleged Level 2 breach of Article 2.2.9 of the ICC Code of Conduct after television footage appeared to show him applying an artificial substance to the ball during the fourth dayâ€™s play of the second Test against Australia in Hobart. Cricket SA said on their website on Monday evening that Andy Pycroft of the Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees had held a preliminary hearing on Monday and heard the submissions of the parties with regards to when the hearing should take place. "Following the preliminary hearing, Mr Pycroft has determined that, in the interests of expediency and in order to protect the integrity of the Adelaide Test, the hearing will take place on Tuesday, 22 November 2016, at 3.30pm (Adelaide time) at the Adelaide Oval." Pycroft will have 24 hours in which to make a decision, which means that there will be an outcome before the start of the final Test on Thursday at the Adelaide Oval. Both Du Plessis and the ICC have the right to appeal within 48 hours, which could see the Proteas skipper playing in the Adelaide Test even if he was found to have breached the code. Du Plessis could be banned for one Test, but the Proteas have defended their captain, with Hashim Amla stating at a press conference last week that the team regarded the allegations as a "joke" and that it was "ridiculous" to say that Du Plessis tampered with the ball while sucking on a mint and using his saliva to shine the ball. The issue has resulted in controversy in Australia, and also a scuffle at the Adelaide Airport on Monday involving a Channel Nine News reporter who tried to interview Du Plessis on the matter. He was prevented from doing so by Proteas security official Zunaid Wadee and team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee, which became heated and saw some pushing and shoving between the reporter, Will Crouch, Wadee and Moosajee.  ashfak.mohamed@inl.co.za  @ashfakmohamed Independent Media
