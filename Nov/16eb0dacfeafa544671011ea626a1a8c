Nairobi - American agricultural company Monsanto is hopeful that Kenya will lift a ban on genetically modified foods in order for farmers to start reaping the benefits of high yields and also to ensure food security.According to Monsanto&apos;s representative for East and West Africa Japheth Sigei, the company is determined to demystify its operations and counter misinformation associated with genetically modified foods.Sigei said that it was unfortunate that Kenya banned the import and planting of GMOs in 2012, due to what he described as misinformation and misunderstanding. He said it was difficult for the public to understand that foods can safely have their DNA changed and called on scientists to stand up and do their part in breaking down the information to the public.Speaking to African News Agency (ANA) on the side lines of the Seed Trade Association of Kenya Congress in Nairobi, Kenya on Wednesday, Sigei said that it would only be fair to lift the ban on GMOs in order to give farmers and consumers more choices in planting and consumption of foods.He denied reports that GMOs were rejected in many countries because they are harmful and instead blamed competitors in the agricultural industry for fanning lies and misinformation about GMOs.Sigei said that those countries that have adapted biotech methods of farming like South Africa, Egypt and Bukina Faso were already reaping the benefits of increased quality yields devoid of diseases that used to plague their crops.&quot;Biotech is a choice. Farmers should be allowed to choose to adopt biotech agriculture. If the yields are good, then the farmers demand for the same will increase,&quot; said Sigei brushing off allegations that Monsanto seeds are designed to enslave farmers by making the soil toxic to non-Monsanto seeds.He said that Monsanto also produces &quot;conventional seeds&quot; which are used in Kenya and many other countries. Some of the seeds already in the market are for corn and vegetables.Regarding the heavily criticised soil and plant chemical Roundup, Sigei said that it is simply a pesticide that effectively kills weeds. &quot;Roundup is not harmful and has been used in many African countries for over 20 years,&quot; said Sigei adding that all Monsanto products are thoroughly tested in labs before being released into the market.&quot;We test to ensure that our products meet the required market quality and standards before being released in the market,&quot; said Sigei. Responding to allegations that Kenya&apos;s lax systems may be allowing in GMOs from Monsanto, Sigei said: &quot;As of now there are no GMO seeds from Monsanto in Kenya. We respect the laws of the country.&quot;Sigei allayed fears in the public that Monsanto would use its corporate muscle to force GMOs into the country saying, &quot;Any product brought into this country (Kenya), goes through a process and regulators verify before it is released into the market.&quot;According to an anti GMO group, The Non-GMO Project, most packaged foods contain ingredients derived from corn, soy, canola, and sugar beet, crops which are largely grown in North America and are genetically modified. The group calls for proper labelling of GMO foods.In August 2015, Kenya&apos;s Deputy President William Ruto announced that the Government would lift the ban on GMOs within two months to allow biotechnology to take agriculture to the next level. Kenya is rated by the United Nations as food insecure and often suffers drought and famine leading to deaths by starvation.GMOs were banned in Kenya in 2012 after a contentious study in France that linked GMOs to cancer. Ruto argues that after consultations with various stakeholders the government had concluded that with the tight regulations and safety measures the country could allow biotechnology to be used in agricultural production.GMOs refer to crops whose DNA have been modified by manipulation of the genes to produce high-yielding, disease resistant and drought resistant crops.Monsanto&apos;s Sigei said Africa, more than any other continent suffers drought and famine due to inability to mitigate climate change and would be the biggest beneficiary therefore of GMOs.
