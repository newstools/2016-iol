Johannesburg – SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter conceded that scoring six goals against a champion club like Orlando Pirates was something out of this world. Matsatsantsa inflicted a record 6-1 defeat on the Soweto giants, the worst in their league history, to jump into the Absa Premiership top two after the latest round of games. “In my dreams it would have been very nice, but you don't think about beating (Kaizer) Chiefs, Pirates and (Mamelodi) Sundowns, the top teams, 6-1,” the former Amakhosi boss said. “We know we can beat them, but it's a bit of a fairytale story isn't it?” Michael Boxall netted a brace, adding to goals by Reneilwe Lethsolonyane, Thuso Phala, Bradley Grobler and Jeremy Brockie as the Tshwane club won in record fashion at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit. It was only the second time that Pirates have been beaten so badly, with the last time being in 1990 against the Brazilians in the Top Eight competition. SuperSport now have 15 points from eight matches, one fewer than leaders Bidvest Wits, as they sit above third-placed Chiefs on goal difference. - African News Agency (ANA)
