Volkswagen has given us a peek at its new premium sedan ahead of its planned debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March next year. The newcomer will be named Arteon and is expected to replace the CC, although VW did not state that outright, simply pointing out that this new “upper mid-class” contender would sit above the Passat in its saloon pecking order. The carmaker says it will usher in a new design language, particularly at the front end where the car features a large double-decker grille as you'll see in the video below.   The Arteon also has frameless doors and a fastback shape, with a sloping hatchback-style tailgate that opens to what VW describes as a “huge” boot. Exterior designer Tobias Sühlmann enthused: “At first sight, the Arteon arouses enthusiasm through its expressive design. It then surprises through its practical virtues. This combination is unique.” Little else is known about the Arteon at this stage, although you can expect the newcomer to inherit most of the Passat's engines and gadgets, perhaps with a few extra innovations thrown in for good measure, given that it's more premium.
