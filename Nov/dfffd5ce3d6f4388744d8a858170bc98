South Africa                           (2) 2 Hlatshwayo 43 (pen), Serero 45  Senegal                                  (0) 1 Ndoye 75      Peter Mokaba Stadium - This 2018 World Cup qualification in Group D is wide open now – and Bafana Bafana are in the driving seat. A positive outcome was expected, but very few thought it would be so impressive, especially against a Senegal team widely seen as favourites to book their seat to Russia as outright winners ahead of South Africa, Burkina Faso and Cape Verde. All the talk coming into this match was about how the Lions of Teranga, who were leading the standings following a 2-0 win over Cape Verde in Dakar last month, while Bafana were held to a 1-1 stalemate in Ouagadougou, would run riot here. Shakes Mashaba, the coach with the home advantage on the day, even had a target on his back with this qualifier billed as a must-win if there were any hopes Bafana would make it to the World Cup other than being hosts since 2002 in Korea and Japan. His men duly delivered a performance worth remembering and one that was perhaps helped along by Ghanaian referee Joseph Odarte, who needed a security escort to leave the pitch. It had been a very pedestrian showing from both sides earlier on. Few shots on target, stray passes and nerves for debutant Tiyani Mabunda, who was called-up as a late replacement for the injured Dean Furman a couple of matches before this crunch game. Mabunda hardly lifted his game, but his average showing was overshadowed by South Africa winning the clash against a strong Senegal outfit. Bafana’s first shot on target came in the 39th minute and was a rather tame effort from winger Keagan Dolly. And then came the biggest talking point of the match when Dolly’s cross from the right flank was headed towards goal by striker Eleazer Rodgers. The ball clearly came off the leg of defender Kalidou Koulibaly, but the man with the whistle pointed to the penalty spot, leaving the Senegal bench absolutely fuming, and rightfully so. It’s a phenomenon in Africa that a “hometown” decision is always inevitable, like when Bafana were away in Ouagadougou last month and Burkina Faso were given an early first half penalty despite defender Mulomowandau Mathoho having made the tackle outside the box. Fortunately for South Africa, goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune guessed the right way to make the save, but Senegal were not so lucky here as captain Thulani Hlatshwayo hit the ball low and hard to give Bafana the lead and lift the crowd. It proved a much needed goal as Thulani Serero struck again two minutes later to give the hosts the edge going into the half-time break – a neat finish that deceivingly looked like the Ajax Amsterdam man had completely fluffed the chance. Naturally, Senegal deployed a pressing game when they returned from the dressing room and put the Bafana back four under immense pressure, until they succumbed to the onslaught in the 75th minute when Cheikh Ndoye benefited from a goal-mouth scramble to pull one back. Mashaba’s men had been guilty of failing to hold on to a lead away to Burkina Faso in that draw earlier last month. They tamed the Lions of Teranga here and gave the country hope that Senegal aren’t that invincible after all. Bafana have heavily upset the odds in Group D, but the journey is long, with four matches still to be played. @superjourno @extrastrongsa IOL
