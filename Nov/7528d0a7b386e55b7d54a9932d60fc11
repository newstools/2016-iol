Durban - The man arrested in connection with the murders of two ANC activists in Imbali is a free man.Gasps of disbelief echoed through the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate s Court on Monday, where charges of murder were withdrawn against 40-year-old Bonginkosi Shabalala.State prosecutor Patty David said the charges were being withdrawn because of insufficient evidence.The two victims, Phetheni Ngubane, 50, and her friend, another ANC activist, 54-year-old Badedile Tshapha, came under fire as they left an ANC branch election meeting in Imbali on June 8.Tshapha died at the scene and Ngubane died at the hospital.Shabalala was arrested the next day. The motive for the murders was alleged to be political. The state alleged at Shabalala s bail hearing that he had defected to the EFF.Shabalala vehemently denied this, saying he was a dedicated ANC member .Shabalala was found in possession of a black bag with a firearm inside when he was arrested. But ballistics tests revealed it was not the weapon used to kill the two women. Throughout the case, Shabalala maintained his innocence. We are devastated. If this man is innocent, then the killer is still out there. We want justice for the lives lost, a relative of one of the victims said. Police continue to investigate the murders.Daily News
