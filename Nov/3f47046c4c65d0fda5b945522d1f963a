Johannesburg - Fugitive sex pest Rabbi Eliezer Berland has pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault and will spend 18 months in an Israeli jail.He was arrested in South Africa in April and deported back to Israel in July after fleeing his home country after several allegations of sexual assault were made against him.The 79-year-old evaded international authorities for three years and avoided arrest by the Hawks twice during his time in South Africa.Last week, Berland signed a plea bargain, and on Tuesday he was convicted of two counts of sexual assault and one of assault after the Jerusalem Magistrate s Court accepted the plea bargain.In the agreement, Berland admitted to some of the charges against him in return for a reduced sentence.During proceedings, the rabbi expressed regret for his actions and asked his victims for forgiveness, saying that he deserved to be stoned for what he d done. I sincerely regret, from the bottom of my heart, all that I have done to harm any man or woman.I regret all harmful acts caused by me, whether it was done directly or indirectly. Judge Yaron Mintkevich said he would honour the plea bargain but made it clear that if it were up to him, he would ve sentenced Berland separately for each of the charges against him because of the severity of the crimes. The four months he has already served in an Israeli prison will count towards his 18-month sentence.Berland, leader of the Shuvu Bonim Hasidic sect in Jerusalem, fled Israel in 2012 after allegations of sexual harassment were made by some of his women followers.He has sought refuge in several countries, including Zimbabwe, Morocco, Switzerland and most recently Holland, where he escaped after being arrested. He took shelter twice in South Africa.[email&#160;protected]@Lanc_02The Star
