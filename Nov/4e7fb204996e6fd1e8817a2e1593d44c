Cape Town - When the ANC National Working Committee (NWC) meets on Monday it will have its hands full with matters affecting its leader, President Jacob Zuma, and other members of the Top Six including Gwede Mantashe and Zweli Mkhize.The NWC may have been preparing to discuss the implications of the State Capture report on Zuma after it was released last week. But reports that Mantashe, who is the party secretary-general, and Mkhize, treasurer, are the subject of an investigation by the Hawks could be on the agenda on Monday.Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, a long-serving member of the ANC in his own right, is said to be under investigation by the unit.Despite being warned by the ANC to get out of politics the Hawks have denied this latest claim.The unit went for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan for eight months until he was asked to come and make a warning statement at its offices. But Gordhan refused and he was subsequently summonsed by the National Prosecuting Authority to appear in court on fraud charges. In an about turn last week the NPA dropped charges against Gordhan.ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa on Sunday described the reported investigation by the Hawks into Matashe and Mkhize as frivolous.He warned the unit to get out of politics before it damages its credibility.The Hawks have denied any investigation into Mkhize, Mantashe and Jonas.Jonas blew the whistle on state capture in March this year. In the report on State Capture former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela said Jonas revealed that Gupta patriarch Ajay Gupta offered him R600 million in instalments and another R600 000 in cash. This was after he was offered the position of his then boss Nhlanhla Nene.The Hawks are reported to be investigating the three men for failing to report Ajay Gupta for allegedly offering Jonas a bribe.Kodwa said the Hawks were treading on dangerous ground by getting involved in political matters. We would like to warn these state agencies, especially the Hawks that they must not play into the political space because they will undermine their credibility, said Kodwa.He described the investigation into the ANC leaders as nefarious. The Hawks have in the past denied being involved in politics.This is the same charge denied by National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams in Parliament.When he appeared in Parliament on Friday Abrahams reiterated his independence to MPs.But he has been questioned at length about what appears to be selective prosecution of cases. siyabonga.mkhwanazi@inl.co.zaPolitical Bureau
