By: Denis Droppa, Motoring Editor Johannesburg - Though Christmas decorations already adorning the shopping malls may be premature, the year is definitely getting into its wind-down phase which means it will soon be time for us to hand out some trophies. Our annual Best of the Best awards reward excellence in the motoring field, and every year we choose our Overall winning vehicle and victors in the following categories: Best Compact Car, Best Family Car, Best Performance Car, Best Adventure Vehicle, and Best Styling. Right now our team of Independent Media motoring journalists are in the process of whittling down all the cars, bakkies, SUVs, and crossovers that have been launched in South Africa over the last 12 months. In the coming weeks we will shortlist the finalists for the overall and category awards, before announcing the winners at the beginning of December. Readers’ competition In the meantime, we need your help. While all the other categories are voted on by our journalists based on their experience of test-driving the vehicles, the Best Styling is a readers’ choice award. Vote on what you think is the sexiest car on our roads and stand the chance to win a Daniel Klein watch worth R2000. Simply email your choice to denis.droppa@inl.co.za with Best Styling in the subject line. Any vehicle sold in South Africa is eligible for your vote, but to help you along here is a list of some potential candidates with head-turning looks. They’re just our random selection and if your favourite car isn’t on this list then by all means feel free to mention it - all votes count. Star Motoring
