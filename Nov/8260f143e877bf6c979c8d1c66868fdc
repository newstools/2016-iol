Will Ray J ever move on from Kim Kardashian? It’s been over 13 years since the two’s sex tape was leaked. Recently Ray J made it clear that he was not impressed by Kim’s husband’s ‘Famous’ video, which featured a nude wax figure in his likeness. He has now released a diss track, which features Chris Brown - who was also one of the celebrities featured in Kanye’s ‘Famous’ video. The song is his response to Kanye West's song and video ‘Famous’, so his title is clearly well thought out. It features harsh shots at Kanye's wife and her family. The single off Ray J’s upcoming album Raydemption clearly calls out his mega famous reality star-turned-mogul ex, with references to their 2003 sex tape that leaked in 2007 On the Drumma Boy-produced track, he raps, “She f***ed me for fame, look in her eyes/ She was the first one to sign on the line/ She was the real one to plan it all out/ Look at the family, they walk around proud/ All because she had my d**k in her mouth.” Last month Ray J told Billboard he was responding to West’s work with his own song of the same name. “You can’t fault me and Chris for responding to all the things that have been done about us [in the media] over the last few months,” he said. As for Brown’s involvement, his sentiments are slightly broader on the song’s hook where he sings, “I know that you cry when you’re going to sleep every damn night/ I’ll f**k around and make another one famous.” Ray J was at Brown’s home in Tarzana, California, last August when Brown was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after a woman accused him of pointing a gun at her.
