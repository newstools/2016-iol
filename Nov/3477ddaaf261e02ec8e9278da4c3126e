Parliament - African National Congress MPs on Tuesday voted down a draft resolution supported by most opposition parties that former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela address the National Assembly.The resolution was proposed by Economic Freedom Fighters MP Floyd Shivambu who argued that though precedent dictated that only heads of state and the judiciary could address the House, an exception should be made for Madonsela.&#x201C;She must share experiences of how do we as public representatives avoid undue delays, undue benefits and corrupt practices that happen in all levels of the state. What&#x2019;s wrong with just listening to a person who has gained this experience?&#x201D; asked Shivambu.Other opposition parties agreed, with United Democratic Movement MP Mcebisi Filtane said an address by Madonsela will help MPs better understand the institution of the Public Protector.&#x201C;She has been a pillar of hope, in particular for the most vulnerable within our communities against the vultures who stood to squander the resources meant to better the lives of the hopeless,&#x201D; said Filtane.&#x201C;Her address to this House will provide an opportunity for her to share with us skills, knowledge, wisdoms she amassed during her tenure and thus position the House to better understand the institution of the Public Protector. It&#x2019;s not about the person, it&#x2019;s about the office of the public protector.&#x201D;ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu however informed the House that Madonsela had been invited by Speaker Baleka Mbete to a farewell function at Parliament, and that this should suffice. He cited parliamentary convention which only allows heads of state and the judiciary to address the House.&#x201C;In our view there are no compelling circumstances to invite a former head of Chapter 9 institution to address the House when there is an avenue that can be used to achieve the same results. We do not see anything fundamentally flawed with only inviting former heads of arms of state and former heads of structures of global governance to address the House,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We again make the proposal that Rule 9(1) be invoked for the Rules Committee to consider extending invitations to other individuals who have made notable contributions to society. Until then we believe that the farewell function, in honour of Advocate Thulisile Madonsela, organised by the Office of the Speaker is sufficient recognition of her remarkable contribution to our people.&#x201D;After the matter was put to a vote, 183 MPs voted against Madonsela addressing the assembly, while 89 voted in favour of the move. There were eight abstentions. African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
