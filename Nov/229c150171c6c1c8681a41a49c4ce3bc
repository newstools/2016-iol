Johannesburg - South Africa&#x2019;s state-owned power utility, Eskom, said on Friday it is considering challenging a report by the anti-graft watchdog into allegations of influence-peddling by a wealthy family that implicated its board and chief executive.Eskom board member Pat Naidoo also said Tegeta Resources, a company controlled by the Gupta family that is accused of influence-peddling, had informed the utility on October 3 that it plans to stop supplying coal to the utility.Business dealings between Eskom and Tegeta formed part of a probe.Eskom&#x2019;s board chairman, Ben Ngubane, on Friday hit back at former public protector Thuli Madonsela, saying her adverse findings on CEO Brian Molefe regarding &#x201C;questionable transactions&#x201D; with the Gupta-owned Tegeta company were &#x201C;not based on facts&#x201D;.&#x201C;Transactions made were entirely commercial. Eskom disputes the Public Protector report as it is not based on facts,&#x201D; Ngubane told reporters in Johannesburg.Ngubane said that during her investigation, Madonsela did not interview anyone at Eskom.AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY &amp; REUTERS Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Follow us on Twitter
