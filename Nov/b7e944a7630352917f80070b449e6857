Maranello, Italy - Ferrari will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2017 but, rather than built just 70 examples of  a limited-edition commemorative model, it has created 70 unique colour schemes, each based on the livery of a particular model or, in many cases, a specific car. These can be ordered on a range of standard models, for delivery in 2017 - and because any excuse to build a Ferrari gallery is a good one, we've picked out nine of our favourites, each accompanied by a shot of the car that inspired it. Enjoy.
