Parliament - Disaster management teams across the country were on standby to deal with severe weather conditions which have hit the country, Presidency Minister Jeff Radebe said on Thursday.&#x201C;The impact of climate change is being felt through severe weather conditions in the form of inconsistent rainfall, drought conditions, excessive heat and flash flooding, Radebe said while briefing journalists in Parliament on the fortnightly cabinet meeting.&#x201C;The country&apos;s disaster management teams remain on alert across the country, especially in areas where more rains are expected. All people must respect and respond to early warning of harsh weather.&#x201D;Several people were killed during flash floods in Gauteng and Mpumalanga last week, with weather services warning of more inclement weather.&#x201C;Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the flooding and wishes those injured a speedy recovery.&#x201D;Radebe said the recent rains have however not had a major effect on the drought conditions still being experienced countrywide. &#x201C;The recent rains should however not draw South Africans into a false sense of security as various parts of the country continue to experience drought conditions.&#x201D; African News Agency
