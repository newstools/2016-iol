Cape Town - The African National Congress (ANC) on Thursday called on all its leaders not to allow themselves to be used by people who sought to advance their own private interests.Commenting on former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela report, titled &#x201C;State of Capture, which was released on Wednesday, the ruling party said it provided an opportunity for the ANC to discuss the allegations and &#x201C;deal with its outcomes&#x201D;, but did not provide details.&#x201C;As the ANC and the country engages with the recommendations of the Public Protector&#x2019;s report, the ANC calls on all its members to remain uncompromisingly intolerant of corruption and the abuse of state power in any form,&#x201D; the party said in a statement.&#x201C;We further call on all leaders and structures of the ANC to remain vigilant against interests that would seek to use proximity to the ANC and its deployed cadres for the pursuit of selfish interests.&#x201D;The party reiterated an earlier decision by its national executive committee to introduce lifestyle audits for its leaders.&#x201C;National Officials of the ANC will also be making declarations of all their interests to the Secretary General. These are some of the immediate initiatives the ANC is undertaking as concrete action to expose and root out corruption wherever it rears its head.&#x201D; African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
