We further call on all leaders and structures of the ANC to remain vigilant against interests that would seek to use proximity to the ANC and its deployed cadres for the pursuit of selfish interests. The party reiterated an earlier decision by its national executive committee to introduce lifestyle audits for its leaders. National Officials of the ANC will also be making declarations of all their interests to the Secretary General. These are some of the immediate initiatives the ANC is undertaking as concrete action to expose and root out corruption wherever it rears its head. African News Agency
