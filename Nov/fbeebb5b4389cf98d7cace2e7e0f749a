Brits - Mark Zinde, accused of killing his mother, former SABC board member Hope Zinde, appeared briefly in the Brits Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The case against him was postponed to December 19 when the State intends to apply for his bail to be revoked, following his arrest on a different charge in Gauteng earlier this month. Zinde was arrested for allegedly attacking his father, Dr Lebohang Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Johannesburg. Manoto, who took him in after he was released on R10 000 bail in the murder case, laid charges of assault against his son at De Deur police station. Zinde was expected to appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court on this charge to apply bail on November 28. Mark Zinde, 23, is accused of murdering her mother who was a well-known journalist and television news anchor. He is facing a charge of murder and possession of drug. The State alleges he killed his mother, 50, at their home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort Dam, near Brits in June. African News Agency
