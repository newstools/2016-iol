Johannesburg - The Cape Cobras will be hoping the return of Proteas allrounder Wayne Parnell will spark an improvement in results after remaining winless after the first five rounds in the Sunfoil Series. The competition takes a break at the halfway stage as the T20 Challenge takes centre stage, and the Cape side would be aiming for a strong start to their campaign. Parnell sustained a rib injury recently after his international recall to the South African team for the Caribbean triangular series. And the left-handed swing bowler has made a statement which could sound like an ominous warning to the current openers in the Cobras team. “I have thrown my hat in the ring last season to be an opener in the limited format,” he said. Parnell slammed 237 runs last season at an average of 47.40 in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge. He also captured 23 wickets in the Sunfoil Series and impressed with three successful five-wicket hauls at the back-end of the four-day competition. “I think one of the things I have learned from being back into the international environment is not to be too overawed about technicalities. Graeme Smith was a very successful opener despite being a bit unorthodox. “One can get carried away about the perfect action. I will want to consistently place the ball in the right areas and ask questions,” he said. As a left-arm bowler, he can operate at speeds of 140 km/h or faster. “The plan is that I will be available for the Cobras before the end of November,” Parnell said. African News Agency (ANA)
