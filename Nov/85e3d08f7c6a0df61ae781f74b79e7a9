Johannesburg - Police Minister Nathi Nhleko was at home in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend after a rigorous week in national politics. In an interview with Independent Media, he challenged his critics to produce facts if they criticised him.The minister&apos;s traditional home, which looks like a luxury Zululand lodge, is 8km from Richards Bay on a dirt road and includes a cattle kraal.He was able to steal a few hours at home after he attended the launch of Safety Month in nearby Maphumulo.Nhleko is clearly where his heart belongs as he was barefoot and wearing shorts for the interview.He said his downtime wasn&apos;t for long as, on Saturday, he jetted off to Indonesia for an Interpol meeting.Nhleko&#x2019;s partner, Dr Nomcebo Mthembu, was with him for the few hours he could escape his responsibilities.&#x201C;I accept constructive criticism but it must be supported with facts,&#x201D; he said, when he was asked if he would work with Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride again.McBride has claimed that he was being targeted for a report into the illegal rendition of five Zimbabweans, an incident involving other senior police officials.Nhleko admitted their working relationship had broken down, but refused to speak about it.On the McBride issue, he said people jumped to conclusions before the matter had been properly concluded.&#x201C;There were misunderstandings because of confusion over [the] interpretation of parts of the Ipid Act,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It has been referred back to Parliament for clarification.&#x201D;On his report on the money spent on President Jacob Zuma&apos;s Nkandla home in which he had said the president did not have to pay anything back, he emphasised that he stood by what he wrote.&#x201C;Nobody has come with facts to deny what I put forward,&#x201D; he asserted. He said he had relied on security experts who had given him a run-down on security needs for the president&apos;s home.&#x201C;For instance, when the security experts visited Nkandla, they found cattle were herded through the same gate used by the president. They said this was inadvisable.&#x201D;Nhleko explained that when he took over as minister, the image of the police had been on a downward slope but he hoped that, since his appointment, this had changed.&#x201C;What happened at Marikana (before his time) and a range of issues had given the police a bad name but we have done tremendously well and introduced changes.&#x201C;But criticism will always be there and I accept it when it is constructive. It does not hurt me because I am in a pot and I cannot measure the temperature. It is only for someone outside to do that,&#x201D; he said, adding the negative was slowly waning.Nhleko said the public protector&apos;s report on state capture was half-baked and was one-sided.He said while he had not finished reading it, his impression was that Thuli Madonsela had rushed it.On police behaviour during the #FeesMustFall campaign, Nhleko stood by his officers and said the police had been provoked continuously. &#x201C;Under the conditions, they did their level-best to enforce the law. A few unruly students wanted to derail a genuine cause regarding fees,&#x201D; Nhleko said.The interview was done in his lounge which houses a big collection of books, mostly on politics and leadership. The open book on the coffee table in front of him was The Black Man&apos;s Burden: Africa and the Curse of the Nation-State by British historian, writer and Africanist Basil Davidson.&#x201C;Everyone should read this,&#x201D; he asserted.The minister said he was planning on spending yesterday afternoon reading, but might switch on the TV to see if there was any decent rugby. He admitted he was a big fan of the Springboks. Throughout the interview, he drank only water and said he neither drank alcohol nor smoked.The Sunday Independent IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
