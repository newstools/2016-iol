Stunt driver Han Yue, who performed the world's tightest parallel parking ever back in 2014, has driven his way into the headlines again - this time on just two wheels! This week the Chinese man took a Mini and drove the entire length of the infamous Nurburgring on two wheels. Though not the longest distance ever recorded by a car on two side wheels, it must surely have been the most challenging attempt ever, given how twisty the 'Ring is. The feat took him just over 45 minutes.
