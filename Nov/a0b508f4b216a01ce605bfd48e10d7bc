Johannesburg - The United National Transport Union (Untu) said Transnet is malicious after it blatantly disregarded a court ruling compelling the company to not force employees to take leave in December. Earlier this month, Judge Christina Prinsloo overturned Transnet’s bid to force employees who are not restricted to operational requirements to take leave during December. However, on Tuesday the union in a statement said the company seems to have no respect for the rule of law or the Labour Court. “Transnet is malicious. Instead of acting in good faith and appealing the judgement handed down against it by Judge Christina Prinsloo, the company decided to cause havoc amongst employees providing them with wrong information about the leave issue,” said Steve Harris, general secretary of Untu. Harris said Transnet is playing a game of cat and mouse with the union since the ruling two weeks ago. “The collective agreement between it [Transnet] and Untu makes no express provision that entitles Transnet to compel employees to take annual leave during shut down periods or periods when operational demands are low.” Untu said it will approach the labour court next week to interdict Transnet from enforcing leave during the festive season, if no amicable solution is found in a meeting set for November 23. “The union will also ask the Court to make a punitive cost order against Transnet,” said Harris. @heidigiokos Labour Bureau
