This is Trump's America, as promised. @newalfer said: that's fine we need a really tall wall. Maybe that way our people start working hard making great not only one country but all. Superintendent of schools Shawn Lewis-Lakin released a statement addressing the online video. We are committed to provide a safe, secure and supportive learning environment for all students. We addressed this incident when it occurred. We are working with our students to help them understand the impact of theirs words and actions on others in their school community. Our school district and every building in it works every day to be a welcoming community for all, inclusive and caring, where all students know they are valued, safe and supported.
