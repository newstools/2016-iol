The city’s coolest hip hop event “Koolin In The City” was a fusion of good food and good music with cool kids flocking to the heart of the city at Corner House on Commissioner Street to celebrate Reason’s collaboration with Steers for the launch of their new Mjojo Burger. The venue was abuzz with activity with leaders of the new school Loot-Love, Gemini Major and DJ Doowap amongst other curators of ‘cool’ in attendance. The roof top event was further illuminated by a performance from host Reason and the Jägermeister Brass Band. The band played a medley of Reason’s hits in ways unique to them in a performance that can only be described as a fusion of all that is “Mjojo”. “Mjojo” is a word that is popular in youth subculture and is most commonly used to describe something cool or awesome. Steers has partnered with Reason who is an embodiment of that and for the first time they screened the campaign’s Manifesto video during the event. The event’s open mic session, which gives up and coming rappers the opportunity to showcase their skill was presented by the brand. Muvhango actor Raphael Griffiths came out tops winning a prize befitting of the most Mjojo cypher of the night. “We are glad to be incorporating South African youth culture into our strategies, we think it’s important to celebrate our young and to encourage them to be themselves. It validates their sense of uniqueness and places them firm in the conviction that their dreams are valid” says Steers Marketing Executive, Adolf Fourie. Other campaign champions include the Major League twins; Banele and Bandile Mbere, musician and producer Gemini Major and Mayo hit-maker Speedsta who epitomise Mjojo in both in their careers and in how are reshaping the South African music landscape.
