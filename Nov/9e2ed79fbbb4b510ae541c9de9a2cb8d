Beijing - From dustbins to street signs to bus stations, public facilities across Beijing will soon have their own QR codes, meaning the public can access the &quot;identity information&quot; or interact with the city management. All facilities will have a QR code before 2018, the municipal urban management commission said Friday. Currently, 50 streets including Beijing's central thoroughfare of Chang'an Avenue have major public facilities with QR codes. When scanned, the code opens an information page on the smart device, which includes contact details for whoever is responsible for maintenance or repair. Public facilities are often vandalized or defaced with fly-posters. Yao Liang with the commission said the QR codes have been rolled out so that problems can be solved swiftly. People can also use the social-networking app WeChat to report any issues to the management or search for the nearest toilet or metro stations. Xinhua
