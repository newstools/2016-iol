David Guetta, the French DJ who hasnâ€™t performed in South Africa in over 5 years, and who has since achieved such career highlights as opening and closing Euro 2016, is no stranger to the Ultra family. Already this year he has rocked the masses having played ULTRA Music Festival Miami in March and ULTRA Europe in July.
