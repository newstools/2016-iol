&nbsp;Pretoria - Campus security guards were individually frisking every Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student boarding the designated buses ferrying them to the secured examinations centre established at the Tshwane Events Centre on Monday.Under the watchful eye of numerous police officers, armed with side pistols and wielding shotguns, the security guards frisked every student and required proof before allowing them onto the buses.On Sunday, a TUT bus was torched near the Soshanguve south campus, as tensions continued to simmer ahead of the exams kicking off on Monday. Another bus was reportedly torched on Monday morning.Last week, TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter announced that despite continued attempts to disrupt the 2016 final examinations, the tests would not be suspended, but would be written at the secured location. A decision was taken that Soshanguve students will write the main exams, as well as the re-exams for 2016, at the Tshwane Events Centre. Residence and day students residing in Soshanguve will be provided with transport to and from the examination venue, said De Ruyter. Students will have to produce a student card and personalised final exam timetable before they will be allowed to utilise the transport provided. De Ruyter said security measures at all the TUT campuses, including the distant campuses in eMalahleni, Mbombela and Polokwane, will be reinforced and the SA Police Service has been engaged to remain on standby during the examination period.African News Agency
