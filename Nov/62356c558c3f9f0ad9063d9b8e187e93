Johannesburg The search for three-year-old Everite Chauke, swept away by a flooded Jukskei River from her home in Alexandra last week, is to resume at Hartbeespoort Dam in the North West on Tuesday.Johannesburg emergency services spokeswoman Nana Radebe, whose team has searched for the little girl throughout Johannesburg along the Jukskei River, said the SA Police Service was in charge of the search at the dam. We are hoping that she will be found today, it has been a long search so far. We will hold a meeting with the police teams later today to map the way forward, she said.The three-year-old was swept away when heavy rains swelled the river in last week. Her father Shadrick Chauke, whose shack was on the river bank, had climbed up a tree with her to seek refuge from the floods when the branch they were holding on to broke and Everite fell into the raging waters.The Chaukes were one of the many families left homeless as the river burst its banks and swept shacks away in one of the worst storms to hit Johannesburg this year.Gauteng Premier David Makhura said at least 4 900 people were affected by the severe weather in the province.African News Agency
