Cape Town - Some Cape Town brides and grooms looking forward to dream weddings have been forced to find new venues at short notice, after the Cape Town Hotel School cancelled events over safety concerns.The decision came in the wake of sometimes violent protests and intimidation at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). The Cape Town Hotel School in Granger Bay, which has about 500 students, is affiliated to CPUT.Couples who booked weddings there have received e-mails from management informing them that holding functions had become too risky: &#x201C;Because of the volatile (petrol bombs, building damages, physical assault as well as SRC closing down all activities at all campuses) situation, our campus is at high security risk, therefore we are unable to host your wedding&#x201D;.CPUT spokeswoman Lauren Kansley said the decision to stop or move functions had been taken by management.&#x201C;The safety of our students and guests is our utmost responsibility,&#x201D; she said.
