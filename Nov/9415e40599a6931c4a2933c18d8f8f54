Cape Town - Busy court rolls at the Wynberg District Court in Cape Town on Wednesday and the absence of the bail magistrate, caused the postponement of a bail application to be launched by one of four men accused of the rape and murder of teenager Franziska Blochliger in Tokai Forest in March this year.In the dock were four men charged with murder, rape and robbery, but because of the rape charge, they may not be named until they go on trial in the Western Cape High Court.They would have appeared before magistrate Hafisa Mohamed, who released two of them on bail earlier this year, but she was not available on Wednesday.Instead, they appeared before magistrate Goolam Bowa, who scheduled the bail application for the accused cited as number one, for December 6.When the men appear again in December, they will each be handed a copy of the High Court indictment, detailing one charge of murder, four of rape and one of aggravated armed robbery. The murder and rape charges carry life sentences.Prosecutor Rene Uys said the State would oppose the bail application, while plea negotiations (a plea bargain) would be finalised in respect of the two already on bail.The bail application is to be launched by defence attorney Monique Carstens.At Wednesday s proceedings, the bail conditions of one of the two already on bail were relaxed to enable him to attend a drug rehabilitation programme as an in-patient at a hospital.At the earlier proceedings when magistrate Mohamed released two of them on bail, she commented: This crime is one of the most violent and heinous I have presided over in my time. She said she sympathised with the community and understood why they did not want the men released on bail.But she added: The court cannot lose sight of the principle that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The 16-year-old Blochliger was found dead in the Tokai Forest on March 7, some 200 metres from the place in the forest where she and her mother had agreed to meet, after the girl had gone for a jog at the popular recreation spot.African News Agency
