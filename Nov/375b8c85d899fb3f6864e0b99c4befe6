Knysna - A national award-winning teacher from Plettenberg Bay was on Thursday acquitted in the Knysna Regional Court of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old child in his class, only a few hours into his trial.Leigh Dunn, 42, who received the Education Department&#x2019;s National Teaching Award in 2012, pleaded not guilty on Thursday. Following only the testimony of a social worker and the child, Magistrate Eugenia Jacobs found him not guilty.The child, during cross-examination, testified the crime his teacher was being accused of did not take place.The teacher was arrested on June 22 last year after claims surfaced he had allegedly sexually abused the boy at a swimming pool in Plettenberg Bay in May last year.Dunn said he was thankful that &#x201C;18 months of trauma&#x201D; was finally behind him and the truth was finally out. &#x201C;I could not believe it when the case came to an end today, as I was expecting it to continue for some time still,&#x201D; Dunn said.He added while his arrest and court proceedings had been traumatic, he found solace in the fact he knew he was innocent and the truth would prevail.&#x201C;And I wasn&#x2019;t alone. I had incredible support from family, friends and the Plett community at large. I even had friends travel all the way from New York to come and support me today. All these people believed in my innocence too.&#x201C;And then I had my faith and so many people out there who were on their knees praying for me. For that I am so grateful.&#x201D;He said while the case was &#x201C;hanging over him&#x201D;, he never experienced any negativity from his community. &#x201C;Even people who I knew did not support me, were courteous, always greeting me when we bumped into each other in the shops.&#x201D;Dunn said he also carried no anger over the case, especially not against the child. He said he saw the ordeal as an opportunity. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t grow when you are on top of the mountain top; you grow when you are down in the valley.&#x201D;Dunn said he hoped to use this experience to help others in similar situations. &#x201C;I want them to know that there is hope even in the darkest hour.&#x201D;Dunn, who was suspended after his arrest, said he was still undecided over whether or not he would return to teaching.
