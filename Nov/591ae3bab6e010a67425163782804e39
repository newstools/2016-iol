Johannesburg - Gauteng police have launched a manhunt for the security guard who allegedly fatally wounded a University of Johannesburg (UJ) student in a student residence at the weekend.Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Noxolo Kweza said the guard, who was believed to have shot and killed the 21-year-old, fled the scene following the incident in the early hours of Saturday morning. The matter is under police investigation and we are currently searching for the security guard, Kweza said.She added that the motive of the shooting was still unknown.The owners of The Yards at 81 Rissik Street, the Affordable Housing Company (Afhco), said they were also investigating.Renney Plit said he regretted the killing and would be doing everything he could to get a full report on the matter. We threw a year-end party for the students, supplying food and cold drinks, which we do every year. No alcohol is allowed. I am told at between 1am and 2am when the security guards told the students the party was over, they attempted to get to the top floor to an entertainment area but were refused access. They pushed forward and a security guard fired a shot, he said.Plit said the guards at the students residences are unarmed so what was being investigated was why one of the guards had a gun.The mother of the old student traveled to Joburg from Mozambique on Sunday but attempts to get hold of her proved futile on Monday morning.Meanwhile student leaders at the university have taken to Twitter to express their anger at their peer's death.On the official #UJFeesMustFall account, @UJFMF (UJ Fees Must Fall) broke the news of the student's death when they tweeted: A student at UJ has been killed by private security when he shot twice in the back. #FeesMustFall #RensburgMustFall #EndSecuritisation. In another post, they tweeted: Police claim, like UJ, the bouncer who murdered a student has no link with the varsity. But students know him from DFC #EndSecuritisation. The #UJFeesMustFall movement also lambasted vice chancellor Ihron Rensburg, saying he should be accountable for the student s death.In another tweeted, @UJFMF wrote: VCs and private security must be held to account for this murder. They have allowed this madness to persist. #RensburgisaMurderer. The university said they would comment on the student s death soon. [email&#160;protected] [email&#160;protected]The Star
