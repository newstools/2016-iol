Durban &#x2013; The African National Congress believes that the &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report released last week by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela should be subjected to a judicial review before a judicial commission of inquiry is even appointed.This emerged at a press conference in Durban, where the party&#x2019;s provincial secretary Super Zuma was speaking on resolutions taken by the party&#x2019;s provincial executive committee.&#x201C;We are particularly concerned that the former Public Protector believes it was not important for her to leave all incomplete and outstanding tasks to her successor, but instead chose to release a report that makes political statements, as opposed to legal findings,&#x201D; he said.Speaking at the same press conference, party spokesman Ndumiseni Ntuli said that the party also did not agree with Madonsela&#x2019;s recommendation that the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng appoint the person to head the Judicial Commission of Inquiry that the report suggested be set up.&#x201C;That is wrong. That is unconstitutional. Why are we told by an outgoing public protector that the president is not capable of appointing a judge? It is illegal and unprecedented,&#x201D; said Ntuli.He accused Madonsela of &#x201C;inflating her authority&#x201D;.Zuma said that the PEC still supported the Chapter 9 institutions, but that it felt that Madonsela&#x2019;s report was incomplete and &#x201C;exceedingly generalizing on a variety of issues, including a serious allegation against the ANC President, comrade Jacob Zuma.&#x201D;Zuma said that the PEC also welcomed the withdrawal of fraud charges against finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Asked for a reaction to comments made outside the Newcastle Magistrate&#x2019;s court on Monday, where Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema said &#x201C;we are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now&#x201D;, Zuma simply said that Malema needed to face the charges against him in court.
