President Zuma&apos;s announcement that embattled National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams must provide reasons why he should not be suspended evoked mixed reactions on social media.While many commentators felt Abrahams was getting his just desserts after the aborted attempt to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, a slew of tweets poked fun at &quot;Pikkewyntjie&quot; and suggested he offer the president 783 reasons why he should not be suspended.The number is a reference to a high court ruling that the NPA&#x2019;s decision to drop 783 corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma was irrational. If I was Shaun Abrahams, before submitting my representations to Zuma, I&apos;d submit summons to appear in court for his 783 counts of crimes. &#x2014; NtuthukoMdima&#x1F31F; (@Dclantis) November 15, 2016 If I was Shaun Abrahams, before submitting my representations to Zuma, I&apos;d submit summons to appear in court for his 783 counts of crimes. If #ShaunAbrahams wants to gain the respect of RSA again, he must reinstate the 783 charges against Zuma.

Someone check if the Guptas control any state tenders for busses. The President keeps throwing his people under them. #shaunabrahams &#x2014; Muz Hunter (@muzhunter) November 15, 2016 Someone check if the Guptas control any state tenders for busses.
