Rome - Pope Francis warned European governments on Tuesday not to take in more asylum seekers than can be integrated into their societies.&quot;I believe that one cannot harden one&apos;s heart to any refugee,&quot; Francis said on his return flight to Rome from Malmo, Sweden, where he ended a two-day visit to the Nordic country for the commemoration of the Protestant Reformation.&quot;It is inhumane to shut the doors,&quot; he continued. &quot;It is inhumane to close the heart. Because, in the long run, there is a price to be paid - one pays politically, just as one can also pay for the carelessness of taking in more people than one can integrate.&quot;France, Germany, Hungary and other European countries have seen a rise in nationalism and growing pockets of anti-immigrant sentiment following the arrival of more than 1 million people in 2015, many fleeing the conflict in Syria.&quot;Those who govern must be very open to take them [asylum seekers] in, but they also need to calculate how they can be accommodated,&quot; Francis said, &quot;because one must not only accommodate a refugee, but also integrate him.&quot;SAPA-dpa IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
