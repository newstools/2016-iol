Johannesburg - The Vaal Dam has reached nearly a third of its capacity as a result of recent downpours, flooding and water released from the Sterkfontein Dam.However, despite the ailing dam now sitting at about 33.3 percent, almost three percent higher than it was at this time last week, Gauteng residents have been reminded to continue using water sparingly.Just two weeks ago the Vaal was only sitting just above 26 percent. We are still dealing with a drought, we re still in it. People must continue saving water and using it sparingly, we must act as if there is no water and use it responsibly, said Sputnik Ratau, spokesperson for the Department of Water and SanitationRatau said that water restrictions that were implemented by several municipalities across the province, including Joburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane, will remain in place.Meanwhile several reservoirs across Joburg including the two in President Park, Diepkloof, Lenasia High, Bramfischerville and Cosmo City were running low. On its Twitter page, Joburg Water said the consumption in Cosmo City, North of Johannesburg, and surrounding areas was exceeding the supply and it had only recovered slightly. Joburg Water has done what it can to recover the reservoir, however consumption has not been reduced at all to help the situation. We cannot pump more water which we do not have in the area, it said.Areas that could possibly feel the pinch due to low levels at the President Park reservoirs include Kaalfontein and extensions, Ebony Park and extensions, Ivory Park and extensions and President Park and extensions.Residents supplied by the Power Park reservoir which is also sitting on low levels were advised that there could be low or no water pressure in areas such as Klipspruit, Pimville, Devland, Eldorado Park and Nancefield.All these areas were encouraged to use water sparingly so that the reservoirs could recover.@Lanc_02[email&#160;protected]The Star
