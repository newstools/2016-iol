 London - Having had the wind blown out of their sails by Ireland in Chicago, New Zealand's nearly seven-year reign at the top of the World Rugby Rankings is not looking quite so secure. The All Blacks conceded 40 points for only the fifth time in history as the inspired Irish recorded their first-ever win over the All Blacks in 111 years of trying. In what was a superb advert for the game, Ireland blazed into a 25-8 half-time lead following tries for Jordi Murphy, CJ Stander and Conor Murray, before the All Blacks threatened to pull off one of their infamous second-half comebacks. Tries from TJ Perenara, Ben Smith and debutant Scott Barrett brought the world champions to within four points but Robbie Henshaw's late try ensured there was to be no repeat of Ireland's near-miss against the All Blacks in 2013. Steve Hansen's side are now just a fraction over five points clear of nearest rivals England following the loss of two full rating points. A gain of two rating points has lifted Ireland up one place to fifth place, on 83.67 points, while Argentina climb three to sixth after their convincing 54-20 win over an experimental Japanese side. Nicolas Sanchez marked his return to the No10 jersey in style with a personal haul of 29 points, which included two tries. Ireland and Argentina move above Wales who are now down to seventh following their dispiriting 32-8 defeat at the hands of Australia. Australia, in third, have increased their lead over South Africa in fourth to a fraction over two points. African News Agency
