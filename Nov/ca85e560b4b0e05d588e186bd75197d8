Johannesburg - The noose is tightening around a senior Gauteng police officer who is facing serious allegations of corruption, as police launch a probe into her conduct.Betty Lufuno Nkuna was promoted from lieutenant-colonel to colonel in August, despite facing serious charges of breaking the law with impunity, selling posts and exploiting her subordinates by demanding &#x201C;lunch and transport money&#x201D; from them, among other alleged irregularities.The controversial policewoman also broke the Public Service Act when she allegedly changed an unpaid leave application to reflect paid leave for a police officer who had been arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill his wife and children.This was according to three police officers attached to the Protection and Security Service Division in Jeff Masemola Street in Pretoria. They also alleged that Nkuna sat on a panel that interviewed her daughter Xihungasi and lied about their being related.They also claimed that she unanimously docked or froze staff salaries and intimidated, threatened and victimised those who opposed her &#x201C;dictatorial&#x201D; leadership.Following The Star&#x2019;s expos&#xE9; last month, the police have moved quickly to investigate the wide-ranging allegations against Nkuna, and said the probe would take about 90 days to complete, &#x201C;depending on the co-operation of the witnesses&#x201D;.One of the police officers who made the allegations against Nkuna said: &#x201C;We are happy that at least, at the end of the day, the matter has received the necessary attention. Our take is that Nkuna must be brought to book. She is not above the law.&#x201D; @luyolomkentane [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
