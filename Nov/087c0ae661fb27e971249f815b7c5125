Perth - Temba Bavuma’s sensational run-out of David Warner at the WACA on Sunday afternoon has had legends of the game raving about the SA fielder’s amazing piece of athleticism. The swoop inwards from point, before unleashing a missile-like throw while mid-air to hit the stumps at the bowler’s end has catapulted the little man from Langa into the global spotlight. Bavuma, though, is the latest to join an elite club of outstanding “superman” fielders South Africa have produced over the years, dating back to Colin Bland, Peter Kirsten, Jonty Rhodes, Herschelle Gibbs and AB de Villiers.
