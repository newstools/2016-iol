Cape Town - In The Big Cat Man: An Autobiography, BBC's Big Cat Diary presenter Jonathan Scott reveals the fascinating – sometimes painful – story of his journey of becoming one of the world's most respected wildlife presenters, writers and photographers. He published the book concurrently with Sacred Nature. From a childhood spent on the family farm in Berkshire to travelling 6 000 miles overland in Africa and starting a career as a wildlife artist and safari guide, Jonathan's tale is that of a lifelong love affair with the natural world. And a fervent desire to see it nurtured and preserved. Beautifully illustrated with drawings and photographs by Jonathan and his wife Angie – herself an acclaimed wildlife photographer – this new autobiography is not only a gripping read but a thought-provoking one. It raises uncomfortable questions about the future of wildlife on a continent where the needs of the people sometimes can seem overwhelming. Adapted from a press release for IOL
