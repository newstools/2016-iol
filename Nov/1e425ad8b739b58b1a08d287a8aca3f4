Cape Town - Not even a broken thumb deterred Cape Argus resident lensman, David Ritchie, from capturing the pictures that would win him the prize in one of the most prestigious journalism awards this year. Ritchie was named Journalist of the Year at the national Vodacom Journalism Awards held in Midrand Johannesburg on Friday night. His series of haunting photographs, titled UCT Under Fire depicted the student protests at the University of Cape Town’s upper campus in February. It was hailed as “brilliant” by the judges and his peers. Ritchie captured a powerful moment when students - who were protesting over a lack of student accommodation - set fire to priceless paintings and other artworks that were housed at the Fuller and Smuts residences as well as in the Jameson Hall. Ritchie had been photographing some students removing the paintings off the walls when he was accosted by a group who demanded he delete the pictures that he had taken. He said they had also tried to confiscate his camera during the confrontation. “As a result, my thumb was injured and I was booked off work. For some time I had to go for x-rays and wear a splint. I was also booked for physiotherapy,” he said. His sacrifice earned him the overall prize. “I feel I owe my success to those who have come before me and all my colleagues and fellow photographers at Independent Media who have imparted valuable lessons. Without their guidance and expertise, I certainly would not be where I am today,” he said. Ritchie walked away with R100 000 in prize money. Judges sorted through 976 entries before naming him as the overall winner.  gadeeja.abbas@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
