Cape Town - The EFF has applied to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete for an urgent vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma to be included in the order paper of Tuesday's sitting. An EFF source said that the request was with the Speaker who had yet to decide on whether to grant the request. However, a source has revealed that ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu would support this request from the EFF. Zuma survived a bruising NEC meeting in Irene that ended on Monday. A motion of no confidence in him was brought by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom. The president is away in Cuba to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro. At the NEC, sources in the anti-Zuma camp revealed that the ANC caucus in Parliament would vote with the opposition if a motion of no confidence in the president was moved in the National Assembly. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is set to brief the media on the NEC outcomesÂ at 2pm on Tuesday at Luthuli House. IOL
