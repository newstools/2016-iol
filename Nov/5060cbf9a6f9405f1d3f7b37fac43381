Port Elizabeth &#x2013; A nightclub bouncer, who claims he helped businessman Christopher Panayiotou to hire hitmen to murder his schoolteacher wife, Jayde, will on Thursday take the stand as a State witness in the Port Elizabeth High Court.The State is expected to call Section 204 witness Luthando Siyoni and proceed with a trial-within-a-trial.On Wednesday, Judge Dayalin Chetty warned Siyoni to be at court at 9am on Thursday.The State alleges that Panayiotou paid the bouncer from his Infinity nightclub to recruit hitmen to kidnap and kill his wife in April 2015. The bouncer was arrested a week after Jayde&#x2019;s killing took place.After his arrest Siyoni decided to spill the beans &#x2013; he turned State witness and charges against him were withdrawn by the State. At the end of the trial Siyoni may be granted immunity for his wrong-doing if Judge Chetty deems him a forthright and honest witness.However, Panayiotou&#x2019;s lawyers have indicated they will challenge the evidence of self-confessed middleman Siyoni. They want his evidence thrown out.According to evidence previously placed before a bail court, Siyoni supplied police a version of events which implicated Panayiotou.Siyoni was then used in an undercover sting operation for the police to gather enough evidence to arrest Panayiotou.The State further alleges that Nemembe assisted Vumazonke to kidnap and murder Jayde at the behest of her husband. Vumazonke who was the alleged link between Siyoni and other hitmen has since died.Jayde was driven to a remote area on the outskirts of Kwanobuhle, where the alleged murder took place. The state contends Vumazaonke fired two shots through Jayde&#x2019;s back and a final shot through the left side of her head.Sibeko was the last suspect to be arrested, 15 months after the murder. He was apparently placed &#x2013; through cellphone mapping &#x2013; outside Jayde&#x2019;s complex in the days before her murder.Panayiotou and his co-accused, Sinethembe Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko face charges that include, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and murder. The businessman is also facing charges related to obstructing justice. African News Agency
