Durban - Gun owners believe the cops need more weapon training and are offering to help.The SA Gun Owners Association (Saga) came up with the offer after a news report that an estimated 50-60 percent of SAPS officers would fail their annual firearm-handling test. If the statistics suggested in the newspaper report are even half accurate, it is an issue of great concern to us and to all citizens, said chairman John Welch.The association is yet to present its offer to the police who confirmed they had not yet been approached by them. I don t think it is necessary as the SAPS academies have qualified trainers, said spokesman Brigadier Maakadikwe Selvy Mohlala.Saga added it was in conversation with various firearm associations and bodies to iron out the logistics of this initiative, prior to presenting the offer to SAPS . Our men and women in blue are the lead agency in combating crime, Welch said. Carrying and using firearms is an integral part of their day. We expect them to be competent to protect themselves and the public against criminals. Rather than sit on the sidelines and criticise the SAPS, who are under-resourced and working in dangerous and trying circumstances, Saga is developing a plan to use private expertise in a useful and supportive role.
