He tried to suck my blood but couldn&#x2019;t pierce my skin.&#x201C;His girlfriend held me down and he bit me on my stomach, on my lower back, he even stabbed me.&#x201C;They said they would cut my body up into pieces, I would be a missing person and nobody would find me.&#x201C;I just started thinking about my kids and I began praying to God, and this man said don&#x2019;t say God here, Satan wants you&#x2019;.She said he pulled down her pants to rape her but she managed to fight him off.&#x201C;Out of nowhere, I managed to get up and make a run for the door, where I found a lady passing by the road and she helped me home.&#x201D;Andor says he later woke up in the park and returned to the house, where the couple told him Theresa had gone home.Theresa said her alleged attackers are yet to be arrested.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve known these people for two years; I never imagined they were vampires who would do this to me,&#x201D; she says.Police spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana confirms a case of sexual assault is being investigated.
