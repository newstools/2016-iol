Bangkok - A Siamese fighting fish with the colours of the Thai national flag has been bought for 53 500 baht (about R21 500) at an online auction, possibly making it the most expensive Betta fish ever sold.Pictures of the fish, with its blue, red and white horizontal stripes mimicking the Thai flag, went viral after its breeder Kachen Worachai posted them on a private Betta fish auction group on Facebook.Kachen said on Thursday he had expected someone to buy the fish for a few thousand baht but was shocked when the bid hit 10 000 baht on the second day.&#x201C;I never expected my fish to go for this price,&#x201D; said Kachen, a 40-year-old convenience store owner who breeds Betta fish as a hobby. He posted the pictures on November 6 with a starting bid of 99 baht and closed the auction on November 8.Betta fish have been bred previously to reproduce the colours of the Thai flag but Kachen said none have come close.He said the highest previous price for a Betta was for a half-moon Betta fish that sold for 23 500 baht.&#x201C;The chance of getting a fish with the flag&#x2019;s exact colour is like one in 100 000,&#x201D; said Kachen. &#x201C;So many people have tried to breed the Thai flag colours. Luck was really on my side.&#x201D;AP IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
