Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education had been paying salaries to dead employees &#x201C;for months&#x201D;, yet failed to pay some teachers on time, a lawmaker charged on Tuesday.MPL Maggie Govender expressed concern in the legislature at the department&#x2019;s fluctuating wage bill, budgeted at R37.7 billion for this financial year. The department receives R45.4bn in funding this financial year.&#x201C;Compensation of employees is a moving target, the department overpays, there are issues of non-payment, dead people are being paid while living people who are working are not being paid,&#x201D; said Govender in a finance committee sitting on education.Earlier, acting chief financial officer Lalsingh Ramadan told the committee the department was set to overspend on leave gratuity payments by R39m as it was &#x201C;difficult to budget&#x201D; for &#x201C;employees exiting the system because of death or retirement&#x201D;.Govender said the department was not handling its leave records properly.Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane admitted the system was &#x201C;prone to abuse&#x201D; and blamed the use of a manual leave system.Department general manager for human resources, Nathi Ngcobo, was also critical of the manual system but also blamed &#x201C;internal inefficiencies&#x201D;.Ngcobo denied that the department was paying dead teachers and said Home Affairs and the Persal payroll system used to pay employees, were linked.
