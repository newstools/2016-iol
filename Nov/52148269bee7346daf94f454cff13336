Pretoria - Members of the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (Nupsaw) have warned of a poor turnout for a march on Friday to the Home Affairs Department in Pretoria because of wet weather. The union is unhappy that its members at the department are not being paid overtime and for working on Saturdays. Nomthandazo Mokobi, who has been working at the department for 10 years, said employees should be compensated for working on a weekend. Home Affairs started operating on a Saturday in 2005. “We are not telling the department to close on a Saturday. But they must start paying us properly for working on a weekend. They need to stop the victimisation of our workers,” she said. In a bid to resolve the matter, the department and the unions engaged extensively and the matter was referred to the General Public Service Sectoral Bargaining Council (GPSSBC), the Labour Court, and the Labour Appeal Court. It is now pending before the Constitutional Court. Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni has assured the public that the department would do everything in its power to ensure minimal interruptions. @heidigiokos LABOUR BUREAU
