The 22-year-old singer is headlining a party at the Fontainebleau five-star hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, on December 31, and the most expensive ticket will set a fan back a whopping $40,000. The VIP package is available for ten fans of the ‘Sorry’ hitmaker who have the cash to spend on the event, and includes a five-night stay at the luxury hotel. According to the Daily Star Sunday newspaper, the package also includes: “Butler service, a private chef, and a party of a yacht.” The deal also boasts “unlimited use” of a range of super-cars, including a Ferrari 488 Spider, a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster, and a Rolls-Royce Phantom. Even the cheapest tickets aren’t for the light-hearted, as general admission will still set one fan back $500. However, despite hefty price tag for the VIP package, the price doesn’t include a meet-and-greet with the ‘What Do You Mean?’ singer himself. A spokeswoman revealed to the publication: “We hope the VIP fans enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But sadly that won’t include saying ‘Hi’ to Justin or shaking hands with him backstage.” The news of the pricey show comes after the ‘Baby’ hitmaker recently caused controversy when he took to the stage in Manchester, England, as he hit out at fans’ “obnoxious” screaming. He said on stage: “Just try to show me you love me, in a different way. I get it. The screaming is just so obnoxious. I get it, it's been in our blood and it's been grand, you go to a concert and scream and stuff.  But if we could just ... scream after the song, enjoy the songs ... the screaming is awesome, it's fine, and then we take a chill pill for a second and we just listen to me speak. Because ... I don't feel like I'm being heard sometimes and it's getting a little pressuring. So, if when I'm speaking you guys could not scream at the top of your lungs. Is that cool with you guy. Bang Showbiz
