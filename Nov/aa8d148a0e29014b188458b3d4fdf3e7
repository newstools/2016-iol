Cape Town - Southern Cape police are investigating a case of common assault against a DA councillor accused of manhandling a colleague during a heated incident over parking about two weeks ago.DA councillor Gert Niehaus and his fellow DA councillor Johan Stander, were involved in a brawl over a parking bay at the George municipality. Full-time councillors are free to use any parking space, as no dedicated parking is provided.Party insiders said Stander was angered by Niehaus after he parked in a bay that Stander had been using for several years.Staff at the municipality said Stander had confronted Niehaus in front of staffers. &#x201C;He was verbally abusive, using foul language in public and followed Niehaus to the second floor offices of the municipal office where they were set to hold a meeting, only to continue his loud ranting,&#x201D; a source said.Another said Stander had manhandled Niehaus, even hitting him with a pile of files before throwing them to the ground.&#x201C;The attack came as a surprise and was completely unwarranted since none of the full-time councillors has an allocated parking bay,&#x201D; another source said.A DA member, who did not want to be named, said Stander was overreacting and should never have raised his hand.&#x201C;Chances of mediating an agreement between the pair are very slim. There&#x2019;s a big rift between DA members in the Southern Cape. The party will have their hands full trying to mend broken fences. There are camps at work,&#x201D; a senior regional party member said.Niehaus declined to comment, but confirmed he had reported the matter to the police. &#x201C;I will await the outcome of the investigation. I am currently booked off on sick leave following the incident but will be back at work on Wednesday.&#x201D;Stander also declined to comment, saying he would wait for the outcome of the police investigation.However, a close confidant described the incident as a &#x201C;storm in teacup&#x201D;, saying Stander must have been provoked.&#x201C;This is nothing but a witch-hunt. There&#x2019;s trouble in the ranks of the DA in the region and it&#x2019;s turning nasty,&#x201D; the source said.DA chairman Anton Bredell confirmed the party and the municipality had launched their own investigations.&#x201C;The George municipality is investigating the matter and will await the outcome of the criminal investigation,&#x201D; Bredell said. Police spokesman Captain Malcolm Pojie confirmed cases of common assault had been opened at the George police station. [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
