Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday termed a report by the South African Council of Educators into the jobs-for-cash scandal a whitewash after it could not give evidence of corruption. Now we can see why SACE withheld the report for so long, DA basic education spokesman Gavin Davis said. Despite investigations taking place from 2014, the SACE report if you can call it that is a grand total of four pages. The methodology is vague, the specific allegations are not documented and it is not clear on what evidence the findings are based on. The result is an amateurish whitewash that absolves everybody of wrongdoing, to the advantage of SADTU. Davis said the report cemented the perception that the South African Democratic Teachers Union had put pressure on the council to sweep the long-running scandal involving the sale of teaching posts for cash under the carpet.He suggested that the outcome of the SACE probe lent credibility to a City Press report last year on allegations that the council s chief operating officer Tsedi Dipholo had been asked by SADTU to abandon it.The report concluded that no evidence of wrongdoing could be found at 13 schools in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and North-West where complaints were probed. It noted that nepotism was rife in filling promotional posts in Mpumalanga, but that it was difficult to unravel the corruption as tracks are well covered .SACE said it was still dealing with a complaint in KwaZulu-Natal.Its chief operating officer, Rej Brijraj, stressed that the council was under no pressure to suppress any case against any educator .Davis said it would be untenable to allow SADTU to claim that an independent investigation absolved the union and its members of wrongdoing.He said had written to the chairwoman of the portfolio committee on basic education, Nomulengelo Gina, to demand that the council be called to explain its findings.African News Agency
