Cape Town - The ages of eight young alleged rapists are not enough of a motivating factor to grant them bail, the State said in a case involving the alleged abduction and gang rape of a 13-year old girl.Prosecutor Phumeza Mtuyedwa-Zondi told the Wynberg Magistrate s Court on Friday even though the men were all under the age of 20, they face a Schedule 6 offence and the State will be opposing bail .Police arrested the eighth accused, an 18-year-old, on Wednesday night while two of the 10 alleged rapists are still being sought.The eight men, who had been charged with the rape and abduction of a minor, appeared less emotional than they had been during their first court appearance a week ago. The group allegedly gang-raped the girl at three different locations in Nyanga during the night of November 11.According to the prosecution, the young girl was walking home at 8pm in Robert Sobukwe Road when she was approached by the first accused in the case, who allegedly held her at gunpoint and demanded she go with him.The 20-year-old accused allegedly took the girl to a shack where he and his friends took turns raping her.It is believed the accused took the victim to two other shacks in the area, where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted before being released the following morning.At first, the eighth accused told the court on Friday he would represent himself, but quickly opted for Legal Aid assistance when magistrate Goolam Bawa reminded him of the severity of the charges against him. Before you make that decision, keep in mind the charges against you include that of the rape of a minor and if you re found guilty the sentence could be severe, Bawa told the 18-year-old.The first accused had also asked for state-assisted legal help while five other accused shared one attorney.Accused number five had his own legal representative.Bawa remanded the case until December 14 for a formal bail application.Meanwhile, the rape survivor has been moved to a place of safety.Siyabulela Monakeli, spokesman for Ilitha Labantu, a non-governmental organisation which deals with abused women and children, confirmed they had recommended that the 13-year-old be moved.[email&#160;protected]Weekend Argus
