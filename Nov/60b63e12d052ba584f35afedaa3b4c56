Sonn said that the lack of integrity among members of Parliament, specifically when it came to impeachment procedures, set them off to initiate change.&#x201C;We plan to march to the National Prosecuting Authority and hand over a memorandum, as they were recently abused for narrow interests.&#x201D;Also present was former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor, who in March this year alleged that the controversial Gupta family asked her to cancel South African Airways routes to India, and in exchange offered her a job as public enterprises minister.Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Black Business Chamber (BBC), and members of clergy sent representatives to the protest.PC Janse Van Rensburg, who attended the protest in his personal capacity, held up a banner which read: &#x201C;Gordhan for Prez.&#x201D; When the African News Agency asked why he felt Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan should be president, he answered: &#x201C;We need a state president, not a Gupta. Gordhan has the confidence, knowledge and good judgement to be president.&#x201C;South Africa is fed up with the scandals,&#x201D; added Van Rensburg.
