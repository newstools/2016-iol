Parliament - Attempts by the DA to oust President Jacob Zuma from office met stiff resistance from the ANC in the National Assembly after the ANC defeated the motion of no confidence with a clear majority.In a fight to the end, during the debate on Thursday, ANC Ministers said Zuma cannot be removed through the backdoor.Opposition parties were unanimous in their voice that Zuma&#x2019;s time was up, and called on ANC MPs to vote against him.During the debate ANC MPs complained that the DA was soliciting their votes by sending letters to them to vote against Zuma.Despite protestations from ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu that this was illegal his counterpart in the DA John Steenhuisen said this was allowed by the rules of the House, and said they needed the votes of ANC members to remove Zuma.
