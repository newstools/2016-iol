You would think that at age 36, and with his team in the doldrums at 22/4, Justin Ontong won’t hang around at the crease for too long. The struggling Cape Cobras had already conceded 478 to the Dolphins on the first two days of their Sunfoil Series clash at Boland Park in Paarl, and a second consecutive innings defeat was on the cards for the hosts. But on his long-time favourite home ground, Paarl born-and-bred Ontong first steadied the ship late on Friday with youngster Keegan Petersen, and then played the innings of his life to produce a career-best 225 to guide the Cobras to 447 all out on Saturday. Ontong batted in positive fashion to reach his 24th first-class hundred off just 168 balls after resuming on 66 as the Cobras started the day on 132/4, still 346 in arrears. But despite the milestone, the stand-in skipper – in the absence of the suspended Omphile Ramela – knew the job of saving the match was far from done. He received excellent support from Petersen, who went to his 50 off 93 balls, and the pair combined for a superb fifth-wicket partnership of 202 in more than 60 overs. But Dolphins spinner Senuran Muthusamy struck a double blow when he bowled Petersen for 86 (183 balls, 12x4) and trapped Aviwe Mgijima lbw for a second-ball duck to leave the Cobras reeling on 224/6. It looked as if the Cape side weren’t going to avoid the follow-on either, but first debutant Dayyaan Galiem (28) and then spinner Dane Piedt (61 off 110 balls, 5x4) knuckled down with Ontong in stands of 60 and 144 respectively to take the Cobras out of trouble. Ontong eventually succumbed to Andile Phehlukwayo for a superb 225, which he compiled in 13 minutes short of eight hours and came off 332 deliveries, with 24 boundaries. It surpassed his previous highest first-class score of 166 in what is his 183rd match. Robbie Frylinck was the pick of the Dolphins bowlers with 3/68, but he couldn’t add to those three scalps he claimed on Friday afternoon. With a 31-run lead and one more day to go, the Dolphins are unlikely to be able to score quickly enough to try and force a result by attempting to bowl out the Cobras. Nightwatchman Muthusamy was run out for one, with the visitors ending on 21/1 at the close.  ashfak.mohamed@inl.co.za  @ashfakmohamed
