Johannesburg - According to a newly released study, 74% of South Africans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction.The study, entitled Pride and Prejudice: Shifting Mindsets in an Age of Uncertainty, draws on the experiences and points of view of nearly 12 000 men and women in 37 markets around the globe. Currently, 48% of South African Prosumers - today s leading influences and market drivers, feel ashamed of their country. This is a large difference from the global average which is 22%.Released by the Havas Creative Group, the study seeks to understand how consumers are responding to intense change and uncertainty in their countries, and how brands can help ease those concerns. South Africans are living in volatile, uncertain and complex times the study indicates that 73% of the country s Prosumers are not confident in the direction the country is headed as opposed to 46% of global Prosumers, says Lou Boxall-Davies, Chief Strategy Officer for Havas Johannesburg.He further explained that brands operating in the South African market may have to adjust their communication to provide a sense of comfort to the consumer as their perceptions and behaviour changes.South Africans are also significantly less happy compared to the rest of the world, according to the study. Sustaining strong moral values contributed 77% to the South African Prosumers happiness whereas global Prosumers felt that it only contributed 50%. Education and skills development contributed 73% to the happiness of SA Prosumers as opposed to 58% globally. It s imperative for brands to be aware of what general concerns consumers have about their country and what makes their consumers happy as it does ultimately affect their lives, how they spend their time and how they choose to spend their money, continues Boxall-Davies.A few of the factors linked to the change in people s behaviour are namely national identity, collaborative democracy and a pursuit of happiness.With the Western culture having such a great influence on the rest of the globe, African millennials have entered into an era of neo-patriotism where a lot of influence comes from major local cultural, political and economic shifts. This has been having an effect on their national identity the study reveals.A majority of people in the nations surveyed believe democracy is the best form of government, but they still see much room for improvement, as revealed through the recent elections where many votes swayed away from the ruling party.Lastly, a fact that has changed consumers behaviours is a pursuit of happiness which shows that 71% of South African Prosumers consider new experiences to be a contributing factor to their happiness.This is a 12% difference from the international standard where only 59% consider new experiences to be a contributing factor to their happiness.IOL Mojo
