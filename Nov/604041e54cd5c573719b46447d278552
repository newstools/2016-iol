Cape Town – A dead body and two limbs have washed ashore at beaches in the Gordon’s Bay area, the ER24 paramedic service said on Friday. Local authorities called the paramedics and other emergency services to the Gordon’s Bay main beach. “Upon arrival, paramedics found a dismembered limb that had washed ashore. Nothing could be done by ER24 paramedics, who left the local authorities in attendance on the scene,” said the paramedic service’s spokesman Russel Meiring. “A short time later, ER24 paramedics were called to Bikini Beach in Gordon’s Bay for another incident. Upon arrival, paramedics found that the body of a male had washed ashore. It was evident to paramedics that this man had been dead for some time.” The same paramedics were then called back to the main beach at Gordon’s bay where another limb was found. The National Sea Rescue Institute were called in to assist in the search for the remains of the body. Police were on scene investigating. African News Agency
