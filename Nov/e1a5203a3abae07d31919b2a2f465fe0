Cape Town - The drive to change the perception that Islam was associated with terrorism inspired former journalist and social cohesion advocate, Yusuf Abramjee, to launch his book #Hajj2016: A Journey.At the launch in Cape Town on Sunday, Abramjee placed emphasis on the spirituality and peaceful aspects of the religion through the lens of the greater Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.The Hajj is a pilgrimage that millions of Muslims undertake at least once during their lifetime - if they can afford to do so - to fulfil one of Islam&#x2019;s five pillars.At the end of Abramjee&#x2019;s first Hajj this year, he documented his experience with more than 12 000 photos captured with his phone&#x2019;s camera.The photos have been condensed into an A3-size landscape hard cover which was launched at the Centre for the Book.Abramjee will donate the book&#x2019;s proceeds to the Awqaf South Africa and Crescent Lifestyle for their Hajj programme. Copies of the hard cover will also be donated to libraries in the Western Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.&#x201C;We know that the religion of Islam is tainted, we have been called terrorists, there is a lot of Islamophobic comments. So the whole idea is to share this journey. Normally Hajj makes news for various reasons but this time we are focusing on the good,&#x201D; Abramjee said.Independent Media executive chairman Dr Iqbal Surv&#xE8; said it was important for people to document their own stories, given the country&#x2019;s chequered history. &#x201C;If you do not document it, those who are in power are going to be the ones who will do the documenting,&#x201D; Dr Surv&#xE8; said.
