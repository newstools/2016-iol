Durban - The African National Congress needs to not only take account of opposition forces but the problems that exist within the organisation, the party&#x2019;s provincial deputy chairman said on Friday.Willies Mchunu, who is also the provincial premier, said that opposition parties posed a serious threat and that they were being aided by internal problems within the party.&#x201C;Where the [Democratic Alliance] DA is succeeding, their success is a reflection of the severe strain wherein our own comrades are tearing each other, causing confusion and demoralisation of our supporters,&#x201D; Mchunu said.&#x201C;This is a clear indication that as the ANC we must remain united because if we fail to do that, we give more ammunition to the opposition.&#x201D;Mchunu was speaking at the provincial executive council of the Veteran&#x2019;s League of Mkhonto weSizwe, the former armed wing of the ANC during apartheid.&#x201C;We need to watch out for some tendencies that remain symptoms of an organisation beginning to self-destruct.&#x201D;He said the organisation was beset with four key problems, being indiscipline; the erosion of the organisations key values; personal interests superseding party interests; and the failure to resolve conflict with in the organisation.&#x201C;Critically, powerful lobbies for personal and business interests have a tendency to target constituent parts of our movement and unjustifiably turn them against structures of governance to achieve desired outcomes. Money or promise of future financial gain has been frequently alleged to be the main culprit vehicle used,&#x201D; he said.He said there was a need to prevent those in charge of financial resources from hijacking the party for their own personal interests.
