Witbank - Three suspected cable thieves have appeared in the Kriel Magistrate&apos;s Court on charges related to copper theft, Eskom&apos;s Security Risk Division said on Thursday.Eskom said the suspects were arrested on the R544 between Witbank and Kriel, in Mpumalanga, when the Hyndai bakkie they were travelling in was stopped by its national contractor staff.&#x201C;The vehicle stopped, and the occupants got out to adjust the cover, as the contents were visible. The suspects were confronted and requested to provide proof of purchase for the copper,&#x201D; said Eskom in a statement.&#x201C;No documents were provided, and the Witbank SAPS (South African Police Service) arrested the three suspects. It was established that 550 kg of copper was loaded on the bakkie.&#x201D;The bakkie and the copper were handed in to police in Witbank. While copper theft costs the economy between R5 billion and R7 billion a year, Eskom said it spends in the region of R2 billion a year on the replacement of stolen copper cables.&#x201C;However, there is hope that this crime will ultimately cease to exist, as the courts have started to take copper theft seriously. This is evident in the form of significant sentences that are being handed out to perpetrators,&#x201D; said Eskom.The national power utility said of the 8 988 cable theft incidents reported between 2012 and 2016, as many as 1 159 arrests were made. &#x201C;This indicates that something is being done to avert this crime,&#x201D; said Eskom.&#x201C;With improved legislation and tougher sentences, the power utility believes that the theft and vandalism of critical network infrastructure will ultimately cease.&#x201D; African News Agency
