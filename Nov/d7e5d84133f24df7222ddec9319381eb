&nbsp;Preoria - The bill against taxpayers stands at more than R4 million - simply because police officials went on lunch while they were supposed to guard the holding cells at a Middelburg court.While they were away, a notorious criminal escaped and later attacked a farming couple, brutally raping the woman and hitting her husband with a hammer 22 times on his head.He also ripped the farmer s ear from his head and injured his little finger to such a degree that it had to be amputated.The Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, ordered that the police - ultimately the taxpayer - had to pay the couple R2.2m.But in the latest claim against the police arising from Mduduzi Nkosi s escape, the court ordered the police to pay R1.7m to Emmarenthia Venter of Middelburg. Her sons Jaco and Johan will receive R214 000 and R132 000 respectively.The sons were also in the house when Nkosi broke in and shot dead their father Johannes Venter.The Venters were attacked in their home on January 22. 2010, about five weeks after the previous attack and while Nkosi was still on the run from the law.He was later apprehended and is now serving a life term behind bars. Just like the farming couple, they blamed the police for the attack.It emerged that Nkosi, while in the holding cells at court, was visited by a friend or family, who handed him a parcel. The police did not bother to search the parcel.When they went for lunch, they also did not post a guard at the cell in the basement of the court.Nkosi managed to saw through the bars of the cell and walk out of the door, which was left unlocked, into the parking lot, .The court earlier found that the police, also in this latest case, were 100% liable for the damages suffered by the Venter family.The 67-year-old woman, who lived on a plot outside the town with her husband and two sons, told the court how she was woken up in the early hours of the morning by a man standing next to her bed.Another man was entering through the window.Her husband was struggling with one of the men. The other simply fired at her, hitting her in the arm. She hit her head against the window sill due to the impact.The injured woman gave the robbers her purse, but heard another shot and saw her husband on the ground. The robbers ran away and the woman ran to Jaco s room to get help.It was only then that she realised she had been hit in the stomach.Jaco said he heard his father calling out for help, but before he could leave his bedroom, he heard a shot. He thought both his parents had been killed and tried to phone for help.He eventually saw his bleeding mother come down the passage and rushed to his father s room.He said his father, who was a large man, appeared to have shrunk and turned blue in colour.He turned him around and saw a bullet wound in his head. He was no longer breathing.His brother Johan went running into the bedroom and they tried to save their father, but he was already dead.The family, who said they were extremely close, said the death of the head of their household had shattered them. They all agreed that if the police did their job by ensuring that criminals in their custody did not escape, this tragedy would not have occurred.[email&#160;protected]Pretoria News
