Cape Town - The Stellenbosch University Council has approved the institution s integrated budget for 2017, which makes provision for an 8 percent general increase in tuition fees and a 10 percent increase in accommodation fees.However, students from families with a household income of R600 000 or less per year will pay the same tuition and accommodation fees as in 2015 and 2016.Council chairman George Steyn said the council also supported the institution s stance that academically deserving students from poor and working class families should receive substantial financial support. We therefore approved an accommodation bursary for the 2 percent adjustment over and above the 8 percent gap funding committed by the government for students from families with a joint household income of less than R600 000 per annum. Such students will not have any increase in tuition and accommodation fees.The increase in accommodation fees follows the university s decision to provide top-up funding to outsourced workers.University manager Martin Viljoen said: Approximately 38 percent of all undergraduate students and 70 percent of black African, Coloured and Indian undergraduate students receive financial assistance.
