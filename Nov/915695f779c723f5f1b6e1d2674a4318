Johannesburg - Traffic on the N1 north, just before William Nicol Drive, Fourways was brought to a halt on Monday night for a family of ducks trapped on the busy highway.In what has been described a heroic action by a taxi driver Leonard Tshabalala, and a paramedic, Max Cohen, the family was eventually rescued.Shortly before 7pm on Monday night, a motorist approached a paramedic on duty in the area. The motorist was close to tears. He informed the paramedic that a family of ducks was trapped in the fast lane of the N1 north.&#x201C;Unfortunately, before we could respond, the paramedic was dispatched to reports of a serious motor vehicle collision, but he called into our emergency operations centre to request assistance,&#x201D; said Emer-G-Med&apos;s spokesman, Max Cohen, who responded to the scene.He arrived to find that a taxi driver, who had stopped in the emergency lane of the freeway, was frantically running around trying to keep the ducks out of harm&#x2019;s way, containing them to the far right shoulder of the highway.Taxi driver Leonard TshabalalaCohen immediately stopped traffic and assisted the taxi driver in herding the family of ducks; a mom, dad and five ducklings, off of the busy highway.Once they were herded to the other side they were each lifted over the barrier and happily waddled to the river below - safe and sound.Emer-G-Med thanked Tshabalala for his bravery and compassion.
