Durban The National Freedom Party on Wednesday welcomed the ruling of the North Gauteng High Court ordering the release of the Public Protector s report on state capture.However, the party s KwaZulu-Natal provincial chairman Vikizitha Mlotshwa said that the NFP was concerned at the waste of taxpayers money used to attempt to obtain an interdict preventing the release of Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report. It s high time now for Zuma and his friends to show their respect to the Office of the Public Protector and the Constitution of this country, he said. Our judges have instilled the sense of hope. However as NFP we are concerned about the waste of taxpayers money by the Office of the Presidency and its Legal Team or Advisors, he said.President Jacob Zuma and cooperative governance minister Des van Rooyen had attempted to obtain an interdict preventing the report s release. This man (Zuma) is not above the law and his continuous undermining and violation of the Executive Members Ethics Act, is a serious threat to the image of the country and is putting it at the risk of losing the confidence of the investors, he said.He said the party would study the report that was released late Wednesday and possibly seek legal advice before commenting further.
