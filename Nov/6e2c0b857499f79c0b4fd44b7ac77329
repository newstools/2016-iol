Durban &#x2013; The National Freedom Party on Wednesday welcomed the ruling of the North Gauteng High Court ordering the release of the Public Protector&#x2019;s report on state capture.However, the party&#x2019;s KwaZulu-Natal provincial chairman Vikizitha Mlotshwa said that the NFP was concerned at the waste of taxpayers&#x2019; money used to attempt to obtain an interdict preventing the release of Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s high time now for Zuma and his friends to show their respect to the Office of the Public Protector and the Constitution of this country,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;Our judges have instilled the sense of hope. However as NFP we are concerned about the waste of taxpayers&#x2019; money by the Office of the Presidency and its Legal Team or Advisors,&#x201D; he said.President Jacob Zuma and cooperative governance minister Des van Rooyen had attempted to obtain an interdict preventing the report&#x2019;s release.&#x201C;This man (Zuma) is not above the law and his continuous undermining and violation of the Executive Members Ethics Act, is a serious threat to the image of the country and is putting it at the risk of losing the confidence of the investors,&#x201D; he said.He said the party would study the report that was released late Wednesday and possibly seek legal advice before commenting further. &#x2018; African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
