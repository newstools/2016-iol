Durban - Political parties in KwaZulu-Natal have described EFF leader Julius Malema&#x2019;s outbursts as nothing more than controversial populism aimed at whipping up people&#x2019;s emotions.Malema caused a stir when he told supporters in Bloemfontein on Monday that former president FW de Klerk would be in jail if his party was in power.He focused on De Klerk because the foundation that represented the former president recently accused Malema of hate speech after he told supporters in Newcastle that whites were visitors in South Africa.Malema said De Klerk, as the leader of the apartheid government, &#x201C;had presided over the killing of black people&#x201D;.Speaking outside the Bloemfontein Magistrate&#x2019;s Court after appearing on a charge under the Riotus Assemblies Act, Malema said: &#x201C;De Klerk has no right to lecture us about incitement, he presided over the killing of our people&#x201D;.He added: &#x201C;Every night when he goes to sleep, De Klerk must pray that Malema does not become president of South Africa, because if I become president, I will lock up De Klerk for the crimes they committed against black people for a very long time.&#x201C;De Klerk deserves to rot in jail, he was never punished for killing black people,&#x201D; said the EFF leader to loud cheers.He asked who De Klerk was to lecture him on democracy.&#x201C;I will never listen to De Klerk. My wish is to see him in prison and suffering for a very long time. They killed our people and slaughtered them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughter of white people, at least for now,&#x201D; said Malema.The foundation has requested a meeting with the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to discuss Malema&#x2019;s utterances, which the foundation said contravened the constitution. The SAHRC could not be reached for comment.SACP KwaZulu-Natal secretary Themba Mthembu said the real intention of Malema&#x2019;s statements needed to be understood.&#x201C;The intention is not what people think. It is pure populism using the sensitive history and experience of our people,&#x201D; Mthembu said. He said Malema should not have been charged under the Riotus Assemblies Act.&#x201C;The people who charged him gave him the platform to display his populism.&#x201D;Mthembu likened Malema&#x2019;s statements to those made by US president-elect Donald Trump, who voiced controversial views which fuelled his growing popularity.&#x201D;He (Trump) was selected for saying the wrong things. It is a demonstration of how people lose faith in the system to a point that a lion can come roaring and people still vote for it,&#x201D; Mthembu said.DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said there was nothing new in Malema making controversial statements.&#x201C;He always made controversial statements during his days in the ANC Youth League. In whatever he says, South Africans should not take him seriously,&#x201D; Mncwango said.&#x201C;It is not something we should focus on. We should rather be focusing on building the nation and our country.&#x201D;IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala said while he did not know EFF policies, the country should work towards achieving social cohesion, reconciliation and peace.&#x201C;It is more important that leaders talk about peace, reconciliation and social cohesion than throw mud into what has been built,&#x201D; Gwala said.&#x201C;The IFP believes in peace and reconciliation. We must talk about what is called social cohesion because we need to create peace rather than cause divisions among racial groups,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We need to work together and put aside differences of the past,&#x201D; Gwala said.Daily News and African News Agency IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
