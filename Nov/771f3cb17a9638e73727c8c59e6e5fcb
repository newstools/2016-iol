Port Elizabeth - Murder-accused Christopher Panayiotou applied for a personal loan of R80 000 to R100 000 which was declined by Capitec Bank, a service consultant told the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday.Claudia Goosen testified in the murder trial involving Panayiotou and his two co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe and Zolani Sibeko.It emerged in court that just about a month before his wife Jayde Panayiotou was killed, the couple visited Capitec Bank to apply for personal loans.It previously emerged that the couple had purchased a house in Lovemore Heights Estate, according to Panayiotou&#x2019;s plea explanation the couple were meant to move in and spend the rest of their lives there. The house was registered in Christopher&#x2019;s name.On March 13, 2015 Christopher visited the bank.&#x201C;The client [Christopher] was in the bank and asked to apply for a loan, he was looking to purchase a house and needed between R80 000 and R100 000. He did not qualify for the loan as minimum requirements were not met,&#x201D; said Goosen.However, Defence Advocate Terry Price disputed the amount and said his client was in the bank looking to secure a loan of R150 000.Goosen said five days later on March 18, Jayde visited the bank to apply for a loan for a &#x201C;deposit on a house&#x201D;.&#x201C;She was also in the bank to apply for a personal loan due to the fact [that] her husband did not qualify for a bond, she was granted a loan of R150 000,&#x201D; Goosen said.Goosen said that Jayde then transferred the R150 000 to her husband&#x2019;s First National Bank account.Earlier this week, Jayde&#x2019;s father Derrick Inggs gave evidence that he had given Jayde R40 000 to settle an outstanding amount on her car. It also emerged that Jayde&#x2019;s parents together loaned her R200 000. Inggs stated that his daughter needed the money for &#x201C;transfer fees&#x201D;.The State previously claimed that Christopher was under financial pressure to keep his slain wife and his lover Chanelle Coutts happy and getting a divorce from Jayde was not an option for Panayiotou because his family would disinherit him, so the State alleges the businessman had his school teacher wife killed instead.It is alleged that Panayiotou paid Luthando Siyoni, a bouncer from his Infinity nightclub, to hire hitman Sizwe Vumazonke to kidnap and kill Jayde. Vumazonke has since died.The State alleges that Nenembe assisted Vumazonke to kidnap and murder Jayde at the behest of her husband.After being driven to a remote area on the outskirts of Kwanobuhle where the alleged killing took place, the State claims that Vumazaonke fired two shots through Jayde&#x2019;s back and a final shot through the left side of her head.The trial continues on Monday.
