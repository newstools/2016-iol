In the wake of the surprise victory by Donald Trump in the US presidential elections, America will have his wife as first lady and Ayanda Thabethe is not impressed by what  Melania Trump has to “teach” young girls. The media personality took to twitter to post three photographs of the first-lady to be, in varying states of undress,  with the caption: “First Lady of the USA. Yah ne... Looks for notes on what to teach young girls .... Be naked and marry rich maybe?! A shame.” First Lady of the USA. Yah ne. Looks for notes on what to teach young girls ....

We don’t think she was ready for that!
