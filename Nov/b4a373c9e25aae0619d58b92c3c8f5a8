Cape Town - Former National Youth Commission chairwoman Nobulumko Nkondlo has been sworn in as the newest member of the Western Cape legislature.Nkondlo, 44, will fill the slot left vacant by ANC Western Cape chairman Marius Fransman, who resigned as a member of the provincial legislature in September.Fransman was asked to step aside after being accused of sexually harassing 21-year-old Louisa Wynand.He subsequently resigned from the provincial legislature and is awaiting the outcome of an internal disciplinary process. Gugulethu community activist Nkondlo said on Wednesday that she was grateful for the opportunity to serve the party and the people of the province. She has not yet been assigned to a specific portfolio in the legislature and will not be taking over the portfolio held by Fransman, since it is reserved for the leader of the opposition - a post currently filled by ANC MPL Khaya Magaxa.The latest addition to the ANC s team in the legislature is expected to influence the composition of the ANC's members assigned to the various standing committees, which is expected to spark a change in allocation of ANC members serving on the various standing committees.ANC chief whip in the Western Cape legislature Pierre Uys said Nkondlo came with a wealth of experience and would be an asset to the work of the ANC in the legislature. We warmly welcome our comrade to our ranks at the legislature and will rely heavily on her expertise and experience, Uys said.Nkondlo, who is already a member of the provincial executive committee of the ANC, heading the party's provincial policy subcommittee, said youth development, issues plaguing women and the disabled were particularly close to her heart. My interest is the economic participation and empowerment of these groups, she added.Nkondlo rose through the ranks of the ANC Youth League as provincial secretary from 2004 till 2006 and served as the first woman chairperson of the National Youth Commission in the Presidency until 2009.Most recently she was employed as director of transformation and youth in the Department of Public Enterprises and is trained in public and project management.Nkondlo pushes the female component in the ANC team of 14 members in the legislature to over 50percent, with eight being women.
