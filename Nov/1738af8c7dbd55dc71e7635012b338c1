Mbombela &#x2013; The acting principal of a school in Moloto Village in Mpumalanga has been given a written warning for selling the food items earmarked for the school&#x2019;s feeding programme, the provincial education department said on Friday.Spokesman for the department, Jasper Zwane, told the African News Agency (ANA) that the department had issued a warning to the acting principal of Matimba Middle School following an investigation into the matter.He said the acting principal, whose name he did not reveal, had sold milk and vegetables while the school was closed for the winter holidays this year.&#x201C;It was illegal, unacceptable and not in line with the policy of the management of the National School Nutrition Programme to sell food during school holidays,&#x201D; said Zwane.&#x201C;A letter was received from the acting principal that was acknowledging that they sold the vegetables and milk. They said this was because they feared that they would rot if kept until the re-opening of schools on 18 July. A meeting was held and the acting principal acknowledged the mistake and tendered an apology. The total amount raised by selling these items is estimated to be R1715.&#x201D;Selling the food items did not affect the programme of feeding pupils at Matimba Middle School, added Zwane. He said the department has made arrangements to ensure that food items in the school were not sold again in the future. African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
