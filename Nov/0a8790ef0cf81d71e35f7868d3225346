Johannesburg - Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has embarked on a fresh attempt to get rid of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride again after his first attempt blew up in his face.However, The Sunday Independent has been told that McBride is ready to take the battle back to Nhleko s backyard.It might well end up in court again as McBride is believed to be already briefing his lawyers to challenge Nhleko s latest manoeuvrings.Sources privy to the situation accuse Nhleko of using state resources to peddle lies against McBride whom they say is now ready to expose Nhleko s lies .Nhleko s latest efforts are now in the hands of the portfolio committee on police, which must decide whether it will take up Nhleko s request to have another go at McBride.The latest attempt by Nhleko came after his recent outbursts against the ANC study group in Parliament and Speaker Baleka Mbete for failing to act against McBride.This followed a Constitutional Court judgment which left Nhleko with egg on his face when the court ruled that Nhleko had no authority to suspend McBride.The Constitutional Court gave Parliament 30 days to look into Nhleko s complaint against the Ipid head but that deadline lapsed without Parliament bothering to look into the issue.This left the door open for McBride to return to his job where he wasted no time in launching high-level investigations.Nhleko, who does not see eye to eye with McBride, has insisted that their relationship has irretrievably broken down. McBride has repeatedly argued that Nhleko is waging a political vendetta against him.Chairperson of the portfolio committee on police Francois Beukman not be reached for comment yesterday.This week Nhleko wrote to Mbete asking for Parliament to revive the disciplinary action against the Ipid head, whom he accuses of doctoring a report into the alleged rendition of Zimbabweans from South Africa.In November, the Pretoria Magistrate s Court withdrew charges of fraud and defeating the ends of justice against McBride on the renditions of Zimbabweans' matter.It was alleged by Nhleko that he had tampered with the report on the former Hawks head, Anwa Dramat.McBride denied the charges against him.The court also withdrew similar charges against his former colleagues, Matthews Sesoko and Innocent Khuba.Sesoko, who was the director of investigations at Ipid, had indicated he was going to fight to get his job back after the court withdrew charges against him.Khuba was the former head of Ipid in Limpopo.The latest attempt by Nhleko to get McBride disciplined by MPs could be decided in the last few weeks of this year's session of Parliament.The portfolio committee on police will consider the letter from Nhleko to Mbete and decide on whether there is any merit in it.Sunday Independent
