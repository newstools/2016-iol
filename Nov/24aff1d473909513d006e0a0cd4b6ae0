Cape Town - Commuters on all Metrorail lines in the Cape metropole have been left stranded as trains are currently delayed for more than three hours. Over the weekend vandalism occurred between Maitland and Woltemade stations at a juncture where all signal cables converge on the lines. This act resulted in the full suspension of services on Sunday to provide Transnet's Technical Team time to repair the system. On Monday commuters were encouraged to make use of alternative transport as trains were either delayed or cancelled throughout the day. Metrorails latest message says the trains are running at an excess of 240 plus minutes across the board. Metrorail is appealing to the public to expose vandals, and to scrap dealers not to accept copper offered for sale without certificates of origin (confirmation that copper was legally obtained).
