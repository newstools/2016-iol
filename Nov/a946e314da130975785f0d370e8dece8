Forget eye-for-an-eye, it's more like stones for a bottle in this road rage spat, which has gone viral on YouTube. The video doesn't show how the fight started, but things certainly got heated after the motorist in the minivan threw a bottle at the biker recording the incident. And that really doesn't justify his next course of action. Not cool, guys.
