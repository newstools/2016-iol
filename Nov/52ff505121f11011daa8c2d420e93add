Ficksburg - Picture vistas of the majestic Maluti Mountains, cosmos flowers as far as the eye can see, 26km of private railway track in such surrounds, with steam trains, trek oxen, tractors, vintage vehicles and airplanes, all toiling away, with you, your family and pals all having the time of your life. The Stars of Sandstone Steam and Heritage Festival is a world-class affair, paying homage to steam and transportation of yesteryear, which will again be taking place in the picturesque Eastern Free-State farming region of South Africa from March 30 to April 9, 2017. Launched in 1999, Stars of Sandstone draws visitors from all corners of the globe at what has been described as the most diverse and amongst the most spectacular steam and heritage event in the world. To add fuel to the fire, or, steam up the fun, the organisers are hoping to launch the Sandstone’s Children’s Railway, complementing the full daily programme of festivities to ensure young and old will be entertained. One of Sandstone’s key objectives in its preservation programme is education to further realise its motto: “Preserving the best of our past for the future.” While many visitors are now seeing what only their grandparents experienced, our offspring often have no cognisance of the importance and romance of machinery of those olden – and golden – days of early transportation. Premier activities for the 2017 festival will include massive double headed Garratts hauling the one-and-a-half-hour Mountain Wanderer train through the mountains. On site accommodation includes former SAR main line sleeper coaches and camping, whilst bed and breakfast properties in the region are plentiful. However, early bookings are advisable to avoid disappointment. Adapted from a press release for IOL
