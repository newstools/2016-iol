Cape Town - Harmony Gold Mining announced on Wednesday that it had officially transferred seven projects - from bee-keeping to digital hubs - to the community in and around its Doornkop mine on the West Rand, not far from Soweto. The seven projects, which involve a range of activities - from the hydroponic cultivation of vegetables to manufacturing of protective clothing, bee-keeping and sports facilities - are all self-sustainable and provide employment for close to 100 people. Also part of the seven projects, three digital hubs provide support to small businesses, youth and community organisations in the area. The projects, in which the community is already active, were officially handed over by Harmony Chief Executive Peter Steenkamp at a function attended by delegates from the Department of Mineral Resources, the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality and members of the community. Steenkamp said the event marked another stage in the company’s strategy to ensure that host communities would thrive even after the mines had closed. “These seven Doornkop projects, planned and developed in consultation with the community, benefit young and old, men and women, those with skills and those with developing skills,” he added.
