Pretoria - One old clinic, turned research site in a township North of Pretoria, will be one of the hubs of a landmark study that if successful, could lead to the licensure of the world's first HIV vaccine. HVTN702, the world's first HIV vaccine efficacy study in seven years, is now underway at 15 South African research sites. Ahead of World Aids Day on Thursday, the study was launched in it's Soshanguve site, Setshaba,on Wednesday and will be one of the first sites to administer the experimental vaccine. South Africa has one of the largest burdens of HIV and AIDS, with an estimated 7 million people infected, 1 000 new infections daily and over 3 million on antiretroviral treatment (ART). The study will establish whether the experimental regimen, safely prevents HIV infection among South African adults. The vaccine is a modified vaccine regimen used in a trial study reported in Thailand in 2009 called RV144. It had shown a modest efficacy of 31.2 percent in preventing new infections, 3.5 years after first vaccination. In the HVTN702 study, the design, schedule and components of the RV144 vaccine have been modified in an attempt to increase efficacy and duration of protection. “Should we be successful, we will approach the MCC (medicines control council) to enroll the vaccine and for licensure”, Professor Glenda Gray (CRT), HVTN protocol chair said today at a packed media briefing at the site. The study aims to enroll 5 400 men and women, aged between 18-25. Researchers will follow up with participants for 36 months in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. Dr Mookho Mahlahlela (crt), a co-principal investigator, said, “The trial is the largest and most technologically advanced to take place in SA, I am truly proud as a South African and researcher to be part of it and at this launch as we commemorate World Aids Day”.
