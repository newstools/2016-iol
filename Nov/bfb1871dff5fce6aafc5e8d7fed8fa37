New York - Imagine Iggy Pop naked. Now imagine 53 naked Iggy Pops. If you liked that, the Brooklyn Museum in New York has just the exhibition for you. British artist Jeremy Deller invited 53 colleagues between the ages of 19 and 80 to a life drawing class - where Iggy Pop was the model. The results are being shown alongside a few other works until March 26. “Iggy Pop has one of the most recognisable bodies in pop culture,” says Deller. “A body which provides a key to understanding rock music and which, over the years, has been paraded around, celebrated and scrutinised like no other. And you could say that he's lived a lot too. That's why I wanted him to be our nude model.” Born in 1947 in the American state of Michigan, Iggy Pop is considered to be one of the trailblazers of punk rock. DPA
