So far the scenes, which first aired in 2013, have been viewed nearly 41,000 times. Meghan was pictured for the first time yesterday (03.11.16) since news of her romance with Harry broke and it has been claimed she already has her own police guard. The brunette star left her house in Toronto, Canada, with a marked police car outside it. Harry and Meghan met in May while the prince was in Toronto to promote is Invictus Games for disabled servicemen. Since then they have been conducting a trans-Atlantic relationship and are said to be smitten with one another. A source previously said: “Harry's happier than he's been for many years. “He's in a very relaxed period of his life and Meghan has come along at the right time.” And Harry is so keen on Meghan, he has reportedly introduced her to his family, including Prince Charles, Prince William and Duchess Catherine. And when asked about her future, Meghan - who has been married before - has said: “My cup runneth over and I'm the luckiest girl in the world.” Bang Showbiz
