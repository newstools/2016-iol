This week's episode of Speed Stars on Ignition DSTV 189 will see musicians Richard Stirton and Gavin Edwards attempt to hit all the right notes around Zwartkops Raceway as the pair take each other on in Opel Adam S hot hatches. Few will forget Richard Stirton's blind audition on The Voice. But being the first winner of the show is just the start for this humble, inspiring 22-year-old musician and we're hoping his 'audition' behind the wheel on Speed Stars will be equally memorable. It was Westlife's Brian McFadden who turned Gavin Edwards' world upside down after spotting the Durbanite and his band performing at Sun City. With Brian as their manager, Gavin rubbed shoulders with the famous and lived the 'rock and roll' dream but after 14 years abroad, the love affair was well and truly over. Entering The Voice South Africa was a redemption song of sorts for this talented musician, as we watched him rediscover his love for music with each honest and heart warming performance. But now the two prepare to face off in a driving contest and you can win an advanced driving course by predicting the winner. To enter, SMS the word MOTOR [space] your prediction (either RICHARD or GAVIN) followed by your name, email address and province you live in to 45607. The SMS costs R1.50. The advanced driving course prize will be held at the Gerotek test facility in Gauteng toward the end of November (dates have not yet been finalised), but the contest is open to anyone in the country. Flight costs will be covered for out of town winners, but you'll need to make your way to either King Shaka airport in Durban or Cape Town International on your own steam. The Stirton versus Edwards episode will air this Saturday night at 7.30pm on DStv channel 189, and SMS entries close at the start of the show. Terms and conditions apply, and prizes are not exchangeable for cash value.
