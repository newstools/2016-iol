Durban - One of the seven people accused of killing Bluff businessman and moneylender, Narend Anandrai, has lodged a high court application to have the State advocate prosecuting the matter removed and another appointed.Veronica Rathilal&#x2019;s application was heard on Monday in the Durban High Court where the acting Judge Joe Nxusani commented on the strangeness of the matter and questioned why it was not brought before a criminal court.The Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal, the State advocate and Rathilal&#x2019;s six co-accused are all cited as respondents. Her co-accused, Rathilal said, were cited as interested parties only.Her attorney told the court, there would be repercussions for the defence counsel if they had not acted on alleged prejudice against his client.Counsel acting for the Director and the State advocate said very serious allegations had been made, that needed to be investigated and asked for an adjournment until next month.The National Prosecuting Authority is opposing the matter.Rathilal, an advocate who was previously instructed by the Legal Aid Board and is currently unemployed, was indicted in April 2015 to stand trial this year for Anandrai&#x2019;s murder.Her co-accused are Claude Reginald, Rajendran Chetty, Shana Mangroo, Sudesh Ghooruhoo, Dhanaselan Manickam and attorney Jayshree Baijnath.They are alleged to have each borrowed money from Anandrai, 46, which they were apparently unable to repay.Further, they are accused of conspiring before the incident on how to have him killed.On Tuesday, March 18, 2014, it is alleged they hired Gregory Pillay to commit the murder for a fee.That night, Anandrai was apparently lured by the accused to Manickam&#x2019;s house and on his arrival, while he sat in his Mercedes-Benz SUV waiting to enter the property, Pillay shot him.His car caught alight after the shooting. The post-mortem examination found the cause of death to be a bullet wound to the chest.The State alleges the murder was premeditated and that all seven accused were acting in common purpose to kill Anandrai.ConfessedPillay confessed to the murder in August and received an 18-year prison sentence.Logandren Francis was previously also among the accused, but subsequently entered into a plea bargain with the State and confessed to being an accomplice to the murder.He was given a five-year suspended sentence.The trial, which had been due to begin in August and had previously been delayed, has now ground to a halt because of Rathilal&#x2019;s claims of irregularities.According to her affidavit, Rathilal denies all the allegations against her and said she would be pleading not guilty to the charges.In her court papers, she accused the State advocate and the investigating officer of acting improperly by meeting her without her legal representative being present.She claimed they &#x201C;attempted to sway me to give evidence against my co-accused as well as various unfair pre-trial practices&#x201D;.Further, she claimed that the State advocate was aware of the investigating officer&#x2019;s conduct in allegedly obtaining documents from her, which she claimed they intended on using against all the accused.She had argued that her Constitutional right to privacy and to a fair trial were infringed during the investigation into her bank account and cellphone records.Rathilal also denied this was an attempt to delay and avoid the trial.&#x201C;The criminal trial has put my life on hold. It has affected my health adversely and indeed will do so until finalisation. I have been diagnosed with Barlow syndrome, Seronegative spondyloarthropathy, Rheumatoid arthritis and a consequent depressive mood disorder,&#x201D; she said in her affidavit.Rathilal said it was only in late August that her legal counsel had picked up on the alleged irregularities when they had noticed her notes on some of her documents indicating that the investigating officer had this information in his docket when she had helped with the investigation. This was prior to her being charged.She said she did not mention this to her lawyer due to her illness and being prone to distraction. She said during these consultation, she had concentrated mainly on her relationship with Anandrai and the improbability of her involvement. She said he was her &#x201C;bread and butter&#x201D;.&#x201C;He (Anandrai) had been the proverbial goose that laid the golden egg and that there was no imaginable reason for me to have been involved in his demise,&#x201D; read her affidavit.Worried about the fairness of the trial, she lodged this application.
