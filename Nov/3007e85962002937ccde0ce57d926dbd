AN episode that could seal Wayne Rooney s sad decline as an international footballer began when he decided to sit down at a piano at the England team hotel in Watford last Saturday night.Joined by Everton defender Phil Jagielka and members of the FA s backroom staff, the group were beginning to make a spectacle of themselves when they were spotted by an England security official.The official immediately walked back through the maze of corridors that link the public bar to a section of the five-star hotel cordoned off for the England team and reported his concerns to Gareth Southgate.England s interim manager responded by asking him to discreetly lure Rooney and Co away from the piano and back to a private area.Southgate noted that the England captain and his colleagues were a little worse for wear and gently suggested it was time for everyone to turn in. He did so respectfully because, until last Saturday night, he had no cause to hold Rooney in anything but the highest regard.The 31-year-old had conducted himself impressively over the course of Southgate s three games in charge, with the caretaker boss even describing Rooney s contribution in the dressing room as gold dust .Even so, it was around 11pm and Southgate was mindful of the fact that at 2pm the following day he wanted his players fit for training.They had played against Scotland on Friday night, winning their World Cup qualifier convincingly, and had enjoyed a rest day on the Saturday. But Sunday was one of two training sessions in preparation for the friendly with Spain; a game that was the fourth and final part of Southgate s audition for the England job.At 11pm, everyone appeared to be heading to their rooms, and until photographs taken by wedding party revellers appeared in The Sun, Southgate had no reason to think anyone had ignored him. He had no idea that Rooney had chosen to secretly return to where a wedding party was only just getting started, and was stunned when it emerged that he had in fact partied until 5am.Rooney s mistake, of course, was to pose for photographs with women at the party, his wine-stained lips a giveaway as to how much alcohol he had consumed.It has now emerged that Rooney had already sustained a knee injury that would rule him out of the Spain game.An injury, it turns out, he suffered when slipping on a bottle as he emerged from the Wembley showers after the Scotland match. Rooney was never likely to start the friendly, with Southgate looking to experiment playing Jamie Vardy in a reshuffled forward line. But the manager wanted Rooney on the bench and expected him to report for training on Sunday.Rooney did train, trying some sprinting drills before complaining of pain in his knee and hobbling off.But clearly it was not serious, given that he is fit and available for United duty today after all. Southgate now knows, however, that Rooney was in no fit state to train at his best for other reasons.And he also knows Rooney was not alone. Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, has said the governing body is now investigating the events of Saturday night and they are still trying to establish if Jagielka and those members of the backroom staff sports masseur Mark Sertori is thought to have been among them also undermined Southgate by returning to the public bar area of the hotel.But England players who chose not to stay at the team hotel, and instead went into London, also seem to have taken the opportunity to party. Sources have told Sportsmail of two nightclubs where up to a dozen England players are said to have partied: the Cirque le Soir and Libertine by Chinawhite, both of which are open until 3am.The FA responded earlier this week by saying they would review the time off afforded to players when on England duty. Indeed, nights away from the camp will now be banned. The England players code of conduct will also be revised.But when Southgate is interviewed on Monday for the England manager s position he will still have to explain the wisdom of a night off when it would have made more sense to let the players have a drink after the game on Friday and spend some time with family during the day on Saturday.Rooney did move quickly this week to apologise to both Southgate and FA technical director Dan Ashworth for inappropriate behaviour. A public statement followed.Friday night, insiders at the FA maintained that it might have been enough to spare Rooney the ignominy of being stripped of the captaincy.But Southgate has already been made to look weak here and come March, when England meet Germany, such action could be required to remind this young England squad who is actually in charge, assuming he is confirmed as Sam Allardyce s permanent replacement.Allardyce may have suggested that Rooney can do what he wants, but that was on the pitch.For Southgate this is an altogether different, more serious situation.&copy; Daily Mail
