London - An airline boss is said to have admitted passengers and crew could be harmed by toxic fumes on flights. Mark Mannering-Smith, head of in-flight safety at British Airways, apparently posted comments saying cabin fumes can “incapacitate” flyers and crews might in theory wear smoke hoods for protection. The comments were later deleted but were saved by staff, according to The Sun. Former BA flight attendant Dee Passon, who blames fumes for being forced to retire on health grounds, said 412 crew had died between 2006 and 2014, some in their 20s and 30s. She believes “aerotoxic syndrome” is likely to have been a factor. She said: “BA knows fumes are happening but does not provide protection”. BA said: “Our safety equipment and training exceed required industry standards.” Daily Mail
