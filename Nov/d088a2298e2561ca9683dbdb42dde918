Nick Cannon is reportedly set to become a father again. The 'America's Got Talent' host already has five-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe with his ex-wife Mariah Carey and is now said to be expecting another little one with his on/off girlfriend Brittany Bell, according to Us Magazine. The brunette beauty - who has been dating the hunk since 2015 - sparked rumours she was with child last month when she was spotted sporting a bump while out and about in Los Angeles, and is now said to be six months along. The baby news comes just days after the 36-year-old rapper's divorce from the pop star, who he split from in 2014 after six years of marriage, was finalised. Although their marriage is now legally dissolved under the eyes of the law, the former couple are determined to remain friends for the sake of their children. Nick said recently: “My ex and I are in a great place and are diligently moving things along so we both can continue to be happy. I am happy for her and all her new endeavours, both personal ones and professional ones. “I've been reflecting quite a bit on my life as a father and how I want to be the best one I can be, the way my father figures were to me. So with that said, I just ask that the public continues to respect our process and remain patient and loving as me and my family aim for happiness.” But the 'We Belong Together' hitmaker's divorce isn't the only thing that's been on her mind in recent weeks, as her relationship with billionaire businessman James Packer has also plagued her thoughts after the pair came to blows during a holiday in Greece and ended their engagement last month. A source said: “The split has been devastating for Mariah. She loved James and was planning to marry him. “She made life changes for this man to prepare for their future as husband and wife, even relocating to Los Angeles at James' request, so he could be closer to his children.” Bang Showbiz
