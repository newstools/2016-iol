&nbsp;Cape Town - The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic communities said on Monday it had suspended the initiation season in Sedibeng this year. In order to avoid any casualty and possible loss of life, the Commission has suspended the initiation season of 2016 in Sedibeng, the commission said in a statement.An investigation by the commission into initiation schools in Sedibeng found that criminal elements have crept into this old age traditional ritual .The investigation found that the ritual has been marred by violence, murder, rapes, assaults, abductions, extortion, initiation schools run by 15 year olds, the mushrooming of unregistered initiation schools, and the illegal occupation of land. Some initiation schools have turned into a haven for criminals , the commission said.The commission said some of the schools were not a true representation of cultural initiation ritual, and that the Constitution and several of the country s laws had been violated. The Commission found that some of the things being done in the name of the Ritual of initiation are in violation of Sections 10, 11, 24 and 27 of the Constitution, the statement said. Unfortunately, these reported acts in the Sedibeng district are in further violation of the Children s Act 38 of 2005, National Health Act, Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 and the Traditional Leadership and Governance Act 41 of 2003 as well as the Sedibeng District Municipality Initiation By-Laws as gazetted on the 21st July 2015. The commission said not only did some of the practices at initiation schools limit the rights of initiates, but it also endangered the lives of children.The commission supported the beginning of the initiation season in various other areas, but said it would keep a close eye on some of the initiation schools. The Commission will be closely monitoring activities taking place during this time so that where necessary remedial interventions will be implemented in order to protect life and limbs of the initiates.
