Johannesburg - Super-sleuth Paul O’Sullivan has scathingly attacked the police and the Hawks, saying incompetence and corruption were to blame for their inability to make arrests in Senzo Meyiwa’s murder investigation for more than two years. O’Sullivan did not mince his words when he accused the police and Hawks of failing to resolve the high-profile case because they were too busy chasing innocent people and leaving criminals roaming the streets. He said although he does not have first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of the investigation carried out by them, he said it  seemed there have been lost opportunities and he was concerned that an initial arrest resulted in red-faces, which tends to point towards incompetence of the investigators. Asked if there was someone in the police who could be held responsible for this case, he said no one would voluntarily take ownership and resign because of incompetence. However, O’Sullivan acknowledged that there were many brave and dedicated men and women out there fighting crime like “lions”, but the penetration of the criminal justice system by criminals had resulted in these lions being led by corrupt officials. O’Sullivan said Meyiwa’s case could be resolved as all crimes were capable of being solved. “Some crimes require more effort than others, due to the quality of the clues left at the crime scene, and other contributing clues. If the crime scene was not handled properly, then it was possible vital clues had been lost,” O’Sullivan asserted. He explained that if seasoned investigators were put on the task and given necessary resources, this case would have been cracked. Meyi was murdered at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, on October 26, 2014. Anyone with any information that could lead to arrests should call Crime Stop at 0860010111.
