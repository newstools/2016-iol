Cape Town - The DA on Tuesday welcomed news that President Jacob Zuma had asked National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams to provide him with reasons as to why he should not be suspended pending an inquiry into his fitness to hold office, insisting his tenure has damaged the integrity of the National Prosecuting Authority.&#x201C;Shaun Abrahams&#x2019;s tenure has been amateurish and deeply tainted by political witch-hunts, which has brought the independence of the entire National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) into disrepute,&#x201D; Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement.&#x201C;We are of the firm view that Abrahams is unfit to hold the office of NDPP, and the intention to suspend him is welcomed.&#x201D;Maimane said the fact that Abrahams failed to apologise for first reviewing charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, which &#x201C;knocked R50 billion out of our ailing economy&#x201D; was proof he was unfit to lead the NPA.&#x201C;Shockingly, Abrahams believes he owes no one an apology for this.&#x201D;The DA said it would submit a Constitutional Amendment Bill to Parliament to ensure MPs appoint and remove the NDPP, to ensure he or she is held properly accountable.&#x201C;There remains too much power concentrated in the President regarding the appointment of the NDPP. Section 179 of the Constitution currently provides for the NDPP to be appointed solely by the President,&#x201D; said Maimane.&#x201C;Our bill requires that the President&#x2019;s decision be informed by a resolution of the National Assembly passed with a supporting vote of at least 60 percent of the members of the National Assembly. This will go a long way in halting the abuse of the NPA for political reasons.&#x201D; African News Agency
