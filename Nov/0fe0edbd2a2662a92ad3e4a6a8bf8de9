Blac Chyna has shared another adorable picture of Dream Kardashian. The newborn baby might only be five days old, but she's already becoming an internet sensation with the photos that her 28-year-old mother and her father Rob Kardashian, 29, have been posting of her. The most recent photo shared by the 'Rob & Chyna' star features the tiny tot asleep in her mother's arms, whilst Chyna smiled and gazed off camera. The photo was merely captioned with an emoji of a tired face as the first few days of raising their small bundle of joy have no doubt been exhausting. 😴 A photo posted by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Nov 14, 2016 at 8:40pm PST Although Dream is the first child for Rob, his fiancée is already mother to four-year-old King Cairo, whom she has with rapper and former boyfriend Tyga - who is now dating Rob's half-sister Kylie Jenner. In a recent Snapchat video posted by Chyna, the young boy is seen telling his new baby sister that he loves her. He said in the video: “I love you so much, and I love my baby sister and you.” To which Chyna replies: “I love you so, so much.” The adorable tot then replies: “Oh thanks!” SNAPCHAT: Blacchynala TAG A FRIEND  @blacchyna FOLLOW @zendayasnapchat @wintersnapchats #blacchyna #fashion #fashiondiaries #fashionista #fashionblogger #fashionkids #fashionstyle #fashionweek #fashionblog #fashionable #fashiongram #fashionshow #fashionaddict #fashionpost #fashionphotography #fashionlover #fashiondesigner #fashionhijab #fashiondaily #fashiondesign #fashionph #fashionshoes #fashioninsta #fashionistas #fashionmodel #fashionkilla #fashionbag #fashionlovers A video posted by blacchyna snapchats (@blacchynasnapchats) on Nov 12, 2016 at 11:11pm PST And King Cairo isn't the only one to voice is love for the newest addition to the famous family, and Rob's mother Kris Jenner recently told her Instagram followers that the bundle of joy “melts [her] heart”.
