By: IOL Motoring Staff The original CX-5 was never a bad looker to begin with, and now Mazda is lifting this crossover's style game to the next level with an all-new version sculpted around the brand's latest 'Kodo' design trends. ‘Completely redesigned’ Revealed just ahead of its world debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week, the CX-5 has been completely redesigned, according to Mazda, and you can expect the newcomer to hit SA streets during the second quarter of next year. The engine range carries over as before, with Mazda mentioning two 'SkyActiv-G' normally aspirated petrol units in 2-litre and 2.5-litre guises, and a 2.2-litre 'SkyActiv-D' turbodiesel, but there's no word yet on whether any of the aforementioned engines' outputs have been increased. To aid its dynamic cause, the CX-5 inherits Mazda's new G-Vectoring Control technology from its Mazda3 cousin. This system creates a more natural cornering sensation by varying engine torque in response to steering movements in order to optimise the vertical load on each wheel. Other new gizmos include a windscreen head-up display and powered tailgate. Watch this space for more information when it becomes available nearer to launch.
