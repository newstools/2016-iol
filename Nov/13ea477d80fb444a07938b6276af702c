Cape Town - The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has done an about-turn on the expulsion of its council chairman Professor Brian Williams and the suspension of council member Songezo Maqula.Williams, however, considers the matter &#x201C;unresolved&#x201D; until he has consulted with his legal team.&#x201C;There never was a case against us. The allegations were always false. The university administration and council were aware that there were no facts.&#x201D;UWC&#x2019;s council withdrew the sanctions against the duo late on Thursday.The university council&apos;s decision to oust the members had been interrogated in the Western Cape High Court with the pair claiming they&#x2019;d been shown the door for trying to arrange a meeting between the council and #FeesMustFall protesters.On Thursday, Alec Freund, senior counsel for Williams and Maqula, told the court when the university council dealt with the matter last year, it failed to follow &#x201C;due process&#x201D; as set out in parts of Section 27 of the Higher Education Act.Freund said he would prove Williams&#x2019;s UWC in an about-turn on Williams, Maqula sanctions expulsion and Maqula&#x2019;s suspension were &#x201C;unlawful&#x201D; and the &#x201C;council did not have the power&#x201D; to sanction the two.Maqula, who had before his suspension been elected to council by the Convocation, a body consisting of the university&apos;s graduates and academics, said he was still shocked.&#x201D;I have never, ever, heard of a person being suspended for just requesting a meeting.&#x201C;And, what makes my case even more bizarre is that I was suspended twice; on November 26, 2015, and then I was suspended again in June this year,&#x201D; he said.The applicants&#x2019; lawyer poked several holes in the UWC council&#x2019;s argument that Williams and Maqula had failed to act in the best interests of the university when they attended a #FeesMustFall gathering in October last year.Maqula said he and Williams had attended the mass meeting on October 31 last year in the hopes they&#x2019;d be able to broker a peace deal.&#x201D;Instead we were accused of agitating violence. They (the council) said there was evidence in the form a video.&#x201D;That was bizarre because there has never been any instance where we agitated violence.&#x201C;In fact, when we went to campus on October 31, we were there to, along with the religious leaders, preach messages of peace.&#x201C;It was an opportunity to say to students that &apos;whatever grievances you have, you need to raise them because it is a democratic space, but we need to protect the institution&apos;.&#x201C;We wanted to find a peaceful resolution to the impasse. But that was denied,&#x201D; Maqula said.In his clients&#x2019; defence, Freund said &#x201C;it would have been appropriate&#x201D; for the university to convene a special council meeting as universities grappling with the #FeesMustFall crisis had been doing the same. &#x201D;There&#x2019;s nothing absurd or unreasonable that request,&#x201D; Freund said.The court case continues On Friday.
