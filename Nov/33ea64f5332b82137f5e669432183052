As the moment of truth neared, Trevor Noah took on a serious tone during The Daily Show.&#x201C;This is it - the end of the presidential race, and it feels like the end of the world.&#x201D;Trump&apos;s lead had strengthened to frightening levels, and Noah told viewers: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve come to the right place for jokes tonight, because this is the first time throughout this entire race where I&#x2019;m officially sh***ing my pants.&#x201D; Video: @TrevorNoah: Wrong place for jokes tonight. &#x201C;Shitting my pants&#x201D; #ElectionNight #TTT16 #DailyShow pic.twitter.com/8tNIKoobSA &#x2014; Brent Baker (@BrentHBaker) November 9, 2016Video: @TrevorNoah: Wrong place for jokes tonight. &#x201C;Shitting my pants&#x201D; #ElectionNight #TTT16 #DailyShow pic.twitter.com/8tNIKoobSA &#x201C;I genuinely do not understand how America can be this disorganised, or this hateful - I don&#x2019;t know which one it is...&#x201D;A sKKKary reality, as Trevor addresses those who didn&#x2019;t feel like voting...

Did someone just shout &quot;Kill Obama&quot;? &#x1F633; &#x2014; Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) November 9, 2016Did someone just shout &quot;Kill Obama&quot;? &#x1F633; Many responded that they&#x2019;d heard the call to murder Obama.If he didn&#x2019;t leave of his own accord, celebs and fans alike joked that Trump would have the SA comedian&#xA0;deported.Twitter user Anaklusmos even offered a positive view of SA president Jacob Zuma, saying: At least Zuma laughs at your jokes about him. Trump will deport you for Trump jokes.&#x201D; @Trevornoah bye, Trevor. It was so nice having you here. &#x1F61E; &#x2014; I&#x2764;&#xFE0F;Hillary!
