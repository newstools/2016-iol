Gaborone - The Trans-Kalahari Corridor Secretariat said it would set up eight new truck stops to provide rest and refreshment services for truckers operating along the road that links Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The TKC is a key trade route and the only over-land link between Walvis Bay and Durban. TKC executive director Leslie Mpofu said the new truck-stops would provide rest and refreshments for drivers in an environment that also guaranteed vehicle and cargo safety. The truck stops, to be set up in Gobabis and Charles Hill (on the border of Botswana and Namibia) and Kang, Sekoma, Jwaneng and Lobatse (Botswana) as well as in Zeerust (South Africa) would include ablution facilities, wellness centres and points where drivers could refill their road safety kits. According to TKC safety regulations, there should be at least one truck-stop for every 80km. Among other efforts to improve the state of the 1900km long road, there are ongoing road developments projects in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. These include road expansion works on the Mankgodi to Jwaneng stretch in Botswana, the Okahandja to Walvis Bay stretch in Namibia as well as the Zeerust to Swartruggens stretch in South Africa.
