Pretoria - EFF leader Julius Malema wants Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to release the state capture report immediately following the withdrawal of President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s application to interdict its release.Malema was addressing his supporters at Church Square in Pretoria amid the continuing shutdown of the capital by EFF, DA and Save South Africa.This was after news has filtered through from the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria that Zuma had withdrawn the application.Malema immediately ordered his supporters to occupy every street in the city because Pretoria belonged to them.Malema added that the new instruction to the EFF lawyer was to make an application that Mkhwebane must release the report with immediate effect.Save South Africa campaign convener Sipho Pityana aslo called fro the immediate release of the contentious report compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.&#x201C;We are vehemently opposed to corruption. We are not a political party, we are not an organisation, we come from different strengths. We are just a group of concerned South Africans, who are concerned about the state of our nation particularly in respect of corruption and misgovernance,&#x201D; Pityana told a media briefing in Pretoria central.&#x201C;We are a people&#x2019;s assembly against state capture. The litany of reports that have been released in the media, reports that come from the Auditor General and other reports cast a very worrying picture of what is happening in our country.&#x201C;We believe the former Public Protector, in compiling a report that is supposed to give us bird&#x2019;s eye view and the depth of what is happening &#x2026; that report is deserving of being released so that South Africans have a good sense of the threat,&#x201D; Pityana said.
