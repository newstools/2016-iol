Cape Town - Moved by the plight of some of the children she taught at Wynberg Senior Secondary, a former teacher is on a mission to assemble book donations to hand over to the pupils there.Ellen Fedele, 40, who lives in nearby Plumstead, said she hoped to inspire children to read more often and also lend a hand with their studies for their matric exams. Fedele, who has taught Grade 11 at the school, said on Wednesday that the experience of having pupils looking up to her as more than a teacher was rewarding. In the process of being a teacher, she had learnt the importance of gaining educational knowledge through giving. I often encouraged my former pupils to spare a thought and donate some books for the next group of matriculants, who may not be so fortunate. What made me start this initiative is the love and joy I had for learners, and the ones I have taught. The big joy is just being with them and helping them whenever they need guidance. My Grade 11 class last year always knew I was there to offer anything they needed, they even started calling my class cupboard 'Checkers', as it had every piece of stationery they needed in the class. She hopes to assemble all kinds of books, especially textbooks. She can be contacted via e-mail, [email&#160;protected], and books can also be dropped at Ken Dry Cleaners in Kenilworth.Cape Argus
