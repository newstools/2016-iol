 Cape Town - Ajax Cape Town Commercial Director Alexi Efstathiou has expressed delight in the appointment of Edwin van der Sar as the club's new board member. The former Ajax Amsterdam, Manchester United, Juventus and Fulham goalkeeper has joined the Urban Warriors board and will use his experience to better the club. Van der Sar, an experienced former keeper and Dutch international, joins former Netherlands goalkeeper Stanley Menzo, who was roped in to lead the Ikamva-based side as a coach. “I think this is a great step by the club and directors. We are delighted to have him on board as we all know him as one of the most celebrated football legends of the game,” said Efstathiou. “This will definitely make Ajax an exciting team and brand. We welcome him with open arms and we hope to see him in Cape Town soon.” On how he believes the club will benefit from Van De Sar's appointment, Efstathiou says the move will help to re-position Ajax as one of best clubs in the world. “We are confident that his appointment will benefit the club, the players and everyone involved as he will bring his expertise,” adds Efstathiou. “We also hope to see him in the next year, so we can discuss ideas such as bringing Ajax Amsterdam back to the city to play games and conduct some clinics.” African News Agency
