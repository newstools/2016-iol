Johannesburg - The ANC in Gauteng on Wednesday condemned lists containing names of possible future provincial leaders it said were being punted for election at the African National Congress national conference next year.The ANC provincial working committee (PWC) said the list contained the names of ANC provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile and his deputy, David Makhura.&#x201C;The two comrades have distanced themselves from these lists. The PWC strongly condemned the circulation of these divisive lists as a form of factionalism and promotion of slate politics, which were condemned by the 12th ANC Gauteng conference in October 2014 and the 2015 ANC National General Council (NGC),&#x201D; the party said.&#x201C;The PWC further reiterates the position on factionalism adopted at the 2010 ANC National General Council that &#x201C;those who engage in such activities are in fact undermining the organisation and its work and at worst, are undermining the unity of the organisation,&#x201D;As the road to next year&#x2019;s elective conference gains momentum within the ruling party, when President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s term would come to an end, the Gauteng leadership said succession discussions have not yet been opened in the province.&#x201C;Before discussing who should lead the organisation, ANC structures will first discuss the political and socioeconomic tasks, which face the organisation and revolution. These discussions will be conducted in a disciplined fashion and will seek to achieve unity and cohesion within the organisation. The discussions will be guided by conference resolutions.&#x201D;The party said it believed that listening and working with communities rather than &#x201C;being fixated with divisive factional lists&#x201D; was the best way to strengthen the ANC.
