Durban - A tow truck owner and his employee have been acquitted of the assault and murder of a rival. Prashim Ramnarayan was charged with the assault, while his employee, Githesh Ragunath, was charged with the murder of Viren Dewcharan.Both men were also charged with defeating the ends of justice for allegedly threatening witnesses at the scene not to talk to police. Both pleaded not guilty in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court and made an application for discharge (acquittal) at the end of the state case on Wednesday.Magistrate Mishi Singh granted the application and acquitted them on the basis that state witnesses had contradicted themselves in material aspects, including what weapon was allegedly used to injure the victim - witnesses claimed it could have been a golf club, iron rod or a baseball bat. There was also confusion created as to who the perpetrators were. The State alleged that Dewcharan was struck with a golf club near the Protea hotel in Hilton on the night of June&acirc; 18, 2014 during an altercation between the two rival tow truck operators. He subsequently died in hospital.In amplification of his not guilty plea, Ragunath, 19, confirmed that he was employed by Ramnarayan, the owner of tow truck business Mr Towing, as a mechanic and tow truck operator.He said Dewcharan owned Umgeni Towing, the main opposition to Ramnarayan s business.On the night of the incident, Ragunath said he and Ramnarayan had responded to an accident on Hilton Avenue in Hilton.A vehicle belonging to Umgeni Towing also arrived on the scene, driven by a man identified as &acirc; Angelo&acirc; and a physical altercation ensued.Ragunath said that Dewcharan then arrived in a private vehicle and he too began assaulting Ramnarayan. Ragunath admitted to waving the golf club in Dewcharan s direction while acting in self-defence to protect himself and Ramnarayan. They then drove to the Hilton police station where they reported what happened.Ramnarayan, 29, corroborated Ragunath s version of events, and said Dewcharan assaulted him on the day of the incident and threatened to kill him.Ramnarayan, however, did not witness Ragunath hitting Dewcharan with the golf club.The pair s attorney, Sergie Brimiah, said he was satisfied that the magistrate s decision had vindicated his clients.Daily News
