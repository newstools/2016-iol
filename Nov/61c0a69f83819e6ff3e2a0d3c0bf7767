Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma's job seems to be safe for now. He will leave for Havana, Cuba, in the early hours of Tuesday morning for Fidel Castro's funeral service to be held at the weekend.His trip to the Carribean Island nation follows a marathon meeting of the ANC's national executive committee in Irene, Tshwane, where several cabinet ministers called on the president to step down.The NEC has released a statement saying that they will hold a media briefing on the outcomes of the meeting on Tuesday afternoon at 2pm.Independent Media understands that cabinet ministers including Naledi Pandor, Aaron Motsoaledi and Pravin Gordhan told Zuma, who was in attendance, in no uncertain terms that they had lost confidence in his leadership. They also threatened to resign if he didn't heed the calls for his head to roll.Independent Media also understands that if Zuma refuses to budge, some cabinet ministers would resign en masse and become ordinary MPs. When that happens the ANC MPs would then support a secret ballot on Zuma's motion of no confidence and vote with the opposition parties in Parliament.@luyolomkentane[email&#160;protected]*&nbsp;For more on this story see IOL on TuesdayPolitical Bureau
