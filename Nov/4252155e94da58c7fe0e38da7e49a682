Berlin - The Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen â€“ two new cruise ships being built for Norwegian cruise company Hurtigruten - are patriotically named after polar researchers from the Nordic country. The two ships will offer cruises in snug warmth to polar seas for around 600 passengers each and be ready in summer 2018 and 2019. Construction is taking place in the Norwegian Kleven shipyard. Hurtigruten also has an option on two more ships. The cruise company began as an operator of postal ships, which are still seen sailing along the Norwegian coast regularly. DPA
