Johannesburg - The United National Transport Union (Untu) says Transnet and its legal team have acknowledged that the company may not force employees to take leave over the upcoming festive season. This comes after the Labour Court in Johannesburg ruled that Transnet had breached the terms of the collective agreement when it forced employees to take leave over the festive season in 2015. It attempted to do the same this year. Untu general secretary Steve Harris said on Friday that Transnet attorney Chris Todd had confirmed in writing that the company did not intend to breach the terms of its collective agreement with Untu. Harris said Transnet had set out a roster for employees to take leave. However those who were not in favour of when the roster stated they should take leave, could object to it. “Untu members must go back to their managers and say that they want to withdraw their leave. If the manager refuses, the member must submit a grievance,” said Harris. Transnet told Independent Media on Friday that it had noted the judgment and its recommendations. @heidigiokos Labour Bureau
