Cape Town - A group of pupils from Wynberg Girls' High in Cape Town have called for the immediate removal of a hostel manager due to racial and sexual abuse. In a statement sent out by Fees Must Fall Western Cape, the pupils say: “We the learners at Waterloo House, would like someone out there to hear us, we have been violated, broken repeatedly and we now feel helpless.” They then list their demands which include the investigation of and immediate removal of the hostel superintendent and assurances that they will not be victimised as a result of the statement. “(She) doesn’t know how to raise children, she has destroyed our self-esteem, and no one seems to take our concerns seriously. Now we are coming to you the outside world. We are writing exams, which we will not jeopardise, we are therefore issuing this statement together with personal accounts of the daily violations we are experiencing at her hands,” the statement reads. The pupils then list “many soul-destroying incidents” they have allegedly been exposed to including the alleged use of the K-word, inappropriate touching and kissing and slut-shaming. “We are living in constant fear of what (she) will do next,” the statement reads. The girls say they would like to be addressed publicly on Friday. Wynberg Girls' has confirmed that the statement is not a hoax but was unable to comment further at the time of publication. IOL * IOL has chosen not to name the hostel manager at this time.
