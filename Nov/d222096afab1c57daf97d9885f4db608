Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma is opposing the bid by various political parties to intervene in his application that the state capture report remain under wraps until he is able to give his input.Zuma&apos;s advocate Anthea Platt told a full bench of three judges, headed by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, that the various political parties did not have a substantial interest in the matter, as it was about Zuma&apos;s procedural right to give an input in a report in which he is implicated.The public protector&apos;s report is binding, so proper procedure must be followed, Platt said.She told the court that the political parties had no interest in this application, nor does the public.Zuma objected that former public protector Thuli Madonsela brought out her report without him having the opportunity of questioning witnesses and giving his input.&#x201C;We say in this application that the procedural requirements were not followed and the political parties do not have a direct interest in this application,&#x201D; Platt said.Dali Mpofu for Cope and UDM earlier argued that the public of South Africa had a direct interest in this matter, as it has a interest in knowing what the president is up to and what the findings of the public protector was regarding Zuma&apos;s relationship with the Guptas.According to Mpofu, the political parties represented in court, represented millions of voters.He also said if the allegations against Zuma was true, there would be reason for his impeachment - something in which the people of South Africa had a direct interest.The judges are expected to rule after tea on whether the various parties may enter the fray.
