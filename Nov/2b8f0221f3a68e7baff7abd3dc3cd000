Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma said he should not be made to personally pay his legal costs for his aborted application to block the controversial State of Capture report.He is adamant that the Presidency - tax payer - had to foot this bill, as he brought the application in his capacity as President of the country and not in his personal capacity.This argument by him was set out in his heads of argument, filed at the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria. A full bench (three judges) two weeks ago ordered the president to file heads of argument within seven working days, setting out why he should not foot the legal bill personally.Various political parties - the DA, COPE, EFF and UDM vehemently objected to the fact that the president used the State Attorney&#x2019;s office as his lawyers in launching his application.The State Attorney handled litigation on behalf of the Government and thus the legal bill gets paid from the public purse.The court earlier slapped the Zuma camp with the legal fees, on a punitive scale, for the entire State of Capture court proceedings. This means that he (or the taxpayer) had to also foot the bill for all the other (political) parties who intervened.This bill is said to run into millions.Counsel for the various parties objected to the tax payer footing the bill and said it should come out of Zuma&#x2019;s own pocket. They said the dreaded Public Protector&#x2019;s report, which Zuma wanted to silence, dealt with allegations of a person relationship between the Guptas and Zuma, which had nothing to do with his position as president of the country.&#x201C;There is no basis in law or fact to saddle the tax payer with the costs incurred in this application,&#x201D; they told the court two weeks ago.Zuma withdrew his application to halt the release of the report on the morning which his legal team was due to start with their arguments. The court subsequently ordered the release of the report by no later than 5pm that afternoon.In his latest court papers, Zuma said the Public Protector investigated whether he, as president, breached the Executive Members&#x2019; Ethic Code which governs the conduct of members of the cabinet, which includes the president.According to him his rights as president were infringed, as the investigative process was flawed.He said it is thus clear that the Public Protector&#x2019;s investigation was aimed at the exercise of the president&#x2019;s duties as a member of government and the Presidency (tax payer) thus had to foot the bill.No date has set down yet when the costs application will be argued before court.
