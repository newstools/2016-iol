Lusaka - Half of Zambia has remained without power three days after a fault on a transmission line, the power utility said on Tuesday. On Saturday, a severe fault occurred on a 330 kilovolt transmission line in central Zambia's Serenje district, resulting in loss of power supply to five provinces. The fault was triggered by lightning. Henry Kapata, spokesperson of Zesco Limited, told Xinhua in a telephone interview that engineers were still trying to rectify the problem. &quot;The engineers are trying to replace the conductors and other elements which were completely destroyed,&quot; he said. When asked when the situation would return to normal, Kapata said it depended on how fast the engineers could fix the problem. The provinces that have not been receiving electricity for the last three days include Eastern, Northern, Luapula, Muchinga and parts of Central Zambia.Xinhua
