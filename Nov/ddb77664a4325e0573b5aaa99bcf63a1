Rustenburg - Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s report on state capture did not have any findings, North West premier Supra Mahumapelo said on Thursday.&#x201C;Unfortunately the report does not have findings. It was going to be better if it had findings. We welcome the report as the North West provincial government. We respect the independence of the public protector office. We support the public protector.&#x201D;He said the report was open to many interpretations and alluded to an agenda of regime change. He added that the report was not tested in a court of law and was similar to &#x201C;street talk&#x201D;.&#x201C;My view is that the report must be a lesson going forward. It must be a lesson that in life avoid doing things on basis of a rumour. Matters related to law are matters not to play with, they are serious matters than can be challenged legally.He said South Africans should wait for processes coming from the report to unfold.In her report titled State of Capture, Madonsela made several determinations, including that President Jacob Zuma appoint within 30 days a commission of inquiry headed by a judge to be selected by the Chief Justice.The report on the capture of the state by the Gupta family was released on Wednesday, following court challenges by President Jacob Zuma, and ministers Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen who had initially opposed the release of the report.On Wednesday, Zuma withdrew his application to oppose the release of the report, while Van Rooyen&#x2019;s second attempt to prevent the release of the report was dismissed with costs, for lack of urgency.
