Johannesburg - Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi says issues within the ANC are a result of how the party is run, and it is critical that it goes back to basics. Nxesi, who was addressing close to 300 delegates at the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) youth structure elective conference on Thursday, noted that if these concerns were not addressed, they would affect how youth structure functions in the future. I want to say to you, that there is a lot wrong in our own movement. There are a lot of people who want to go to the opposition party. It is because of how we have handled them within our own organisations. It is how we have been running our organisations. It is very important that we go to the basics, said Nxesi. He went on to blame greed as the core reason for the party s problems. As young workers, look at what is going on in the ANC, the other unions, look at the performance in the elections. We have lost some of the areas because of factionalism. This is based on greed. Nxesi, who is the SACP national deputy chairman, said the focus in the ruling party had shifted from the interest of the people to the power one possesses when in power. It s no longer about leading the union or leading the ANC. It is how I get this powerful position in order to have access to these resources. The NUM structure is discussing how to conscientise youth to advance worker s power and the revolution for three days. ANC Youth League secretary general Njabulo Nzuza told delegates that unity of the youth was fundamental for the survival of the NUM. This view was shared by Nxesi. If we do not unify as the youth, we can never move forward, said Nzuza. He urged the youth structure to work hard for its future. There is no one that will hand your future to you on a silver platter. You need to fight for it. @heidigiokosLabour Bureau
