Bloemfontein – EFF leader Julius Malema's driver was reportedly arrested on Monday for allegedly driving at 187km/h and for failing to stop at a roadblock in the Free State. This was ahead of Malema’s appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of incitement after he allegedly urged people to occupy vacant land. Malema's case has however been postponed until June 2017. Earlier, Free State government official, Hillary Mophethehe, said Malema had been nabbed for speeding, which the EFF leader denied in a tweet:  EFF Free State MPL Moletsane Moletsane told supporters outside Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court that government was advancing his party’s political programme. “We say hands off our CIC [commander in chief], now traffic cops are looking for him all over… they won’t stop us. We are here to defend the Freedom Charter, this is not only about the EFF and the CIC, but everyone of us.” Earlier police cordoned off Brand Street in Bloemfontein and the city’s magistrate court precinct ahead of his appearance. Barricades were placed in front of the court entrance while officers directed traffic away from the precinct. At the end of the street an EFF truck was parked, from which Malema would address his party supporters. African News Agency
