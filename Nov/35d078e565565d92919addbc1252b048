Cape Town - The Western Cape flying squad is severely under-resourced. Its staff complement has been halved over the past five years, sparking concerns residents could be left vulnerable.Sketching a grim picture in the provincial legislature, DA MPL Mireille Wenger said there had been a 55 percent reduction in the staffing numbers. &#x201C;The officers assigned to the single SAPS flying squad in our province was 200 officers in 2011, and this has been whittled down to just 90 officers, a 55 percent reduction,&#x201D; she said.The information was revealed by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko during a recent reply to a parliamentary question in the National Assembly.The information provided by the national police indicates that although other provinces have seen marginal reductions in their police complement, the Western Cape was worst off, with more than double the number of cuts.&#x201C;Other provinces with similar populations to serve have several more units. Gauteng has the most number of flying squads at seven, the Eastern Cape has six units and Mpumalanga and North West have more flying squads than we do, at three each,&#x201D; Wenger said.Wenger said the flying squad in the Western Cape was one of the most depleted units in South Africa. &#x201C;We have only 90 officers to serve our flying squad, yet the Free State has 232 officers assigned to its flying squads and Gauteng has 720.&#x201D;ANC Western Cape community spokesman Pat Lekker said the ANC would take the matter up directly with Nhleko and his department through its members in the National Assembly as this competency does not reside at a provincial level.ACDP MPL Ferlon Christians said the party was also concerned about the understaffing in a province where violent crime was rife. &#x201C;It is a big concern because for a long time we have called for more police resources in the province.&#x201D;EFF MPL Bernard Joseph said better planning was needed to address police under-resourcing in general in the province. &#x201C;It is the poorest of the poor who are the biggest losers in the battle against crime. Something is wrong. This is an intergovernmental problem, not just a policing one.Wenger said as chairman of the provincial parliamentary standing committee on community safety she would take up the matter with Nhleko.
