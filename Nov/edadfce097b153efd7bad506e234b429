Cape Town - It's official - Mos Def will need to leave the country by Tuesday night after being declared undesirable by the Department of Home Affairs.Director General Mkuseli Apleni declared that rapper/actor Dante Terrel Smith, also known as Mos Def and Yasiin Bey, was an undesirable person after he was found to be in the country illegally. In January this year, he was arrested after trying to enter the country with an unofficial travel document - a World Passport - which he claimed allowed him to travel freely. The World Passport has been issued by the World Service Authority, a Washington-based company, since the 1950s to stateless individuals and identifies carriers as human beings, rather than citizens of a particular country.The document is not recognised by the South African government and Smith was charged with using a false identity, using an unrecognised travel document and helping his family stay in the country illegally.He needs to be out of the country by Tuesday night or face prosecution. Apleni said the government had accepted Smith's apology to the country.Cape Argus
