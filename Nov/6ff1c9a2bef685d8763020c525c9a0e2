Durban - A David and Goliath tale played itself out in court on Wednesday when an independent candidate in KwaZulu-Natal battled with the election authorities over the results of the poll in his ward.Blessing Mwali took the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to the Electoral Court to have the August 3 municipal results for Ward 23 in Newcastle, won by the ANC, reviewed and set aside.Mwali, of Madadeni, is arguing that many of those who voted did not reside in the ward.It was the fourth time the Electoral Court had been asked to intervene in the province in similar cases.At on Wednesday&#x2019;s hearing, in the Durban High Court, the ANC joined the case as an interested party.Mwali, who represented himself, took legal action after the IEC rejected his objection to the election outcome.Speaking to the Daily News, Mwali said he was pursuing the matter, aware that he was putting his life at risk.The hearing took place on the same day by-elections were held in another ward in the same municipality where a dead candidate won the ward posthumously.In his court papers, Mwali said the elections were not free and fair because more than 500 voters cast ballots in the ward although they did not live there.&#x201C;They reside in wards 26, 35, 37, 38 and seven,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Other voters do not have addresses in the voters&#x2019; roll, which is surprising,&#x201D; he said in court papers.Mwali said many of his supporters were turned away from voting stations and sent to vote in other wards, against the local government election laws.CombinedHe also claimed that ballot papers were combined with the photo of his former party, the ANC, giving an impression he was &#x201C;still working at the said party&#x201D;.In his court papers, IEC&#x2019;s chief executive officer, Mosotho Moepya, had initially dismissed Mwali&#x2019;s objection on the grounds it would not have material to the outcome of the final results of the elections.Moepya said the IEC was not obliged to verify the addresses of the voters applying to register.Moepya also said Mwali&#x2019;s photo had appeared above the ANC on the ballot paper, which was approved by all parties contesting the elections.Judgment was reserved.
