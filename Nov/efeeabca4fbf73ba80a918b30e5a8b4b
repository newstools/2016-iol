Johannesburg - The South African Policing Union (Sapu) on Tuesday said it was concerned that the term of suspended national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, could end before her long-running disciplinary matter was concluded. Phiyega was suspended on full pay more than a year ago by President Jacob Zuma. This after a commission, headed by retired Judge Ian Farlam to investigate police actions that led to the deaths of 34 striking Lonmin mine workers at Marikana on 16 August 2012, recommended that Phiyega face an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. At the time, the Presidency said: The suspension is to endure, pending any decision that is made following upon the recommendations of the Board of Inquiry into allegations of misconduct, her fitness to hold office and her capacity to execute official duties efficiently. Although calls to Phiyega's cellphone have gone unanswered, Sapu spokesperson, Oscar Skommere, said: National police commissioner Riah Phiyega is currently on suspension and we are hoping that the commission will come to the conclusion before her term expires. Skommere said Phiyega's five-year term expires next year. She was suspended in October 2015. Phiyega was appointed in June 2012 to replace Bheki Cele, who was fired after a presidential board of inquiry found him unfit for office. African News Agency
