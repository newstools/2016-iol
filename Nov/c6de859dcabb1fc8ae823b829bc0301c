 Polokwane - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Friday said that Limpopo Grade 12 pupils implicated in the matric Mathematics Paper II question paper scandal confessed to having shared the paper. According to Motshekga two pupils from Giyani High School have confessed that they shared the paper with others before writing the paper on Monday. Addressing a media briefing at the department’s provincial headquarters, Motshekga said their confessions were followed up and tracking indicated that the paper was leaked from Gauteng to Limpopo. “The learner has come forward and made confession voluntarily and he has made a full disclosure which is extremely helpful in taking investigations forwards,” said Motshekga. Last year, a paper leaked from the department storage and made headlines after learners shared the paper. However, Motshekga said preliminary investigations indicated that a learner from Gauteng sent the paper to a learner in Giyani seeking solutions to the paper. She said other learners from the school have also come forward and admitted to having received the question paper from a WhatsApp chat group. “I am deeply disappointed by this unfortunate incident which has the potential of tarnishing the credibility of the National Senior Certificate examination,” said Motshekga. Motshekga said the department has reported the case to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) for further investigations. “We have commenced with our investigations and we have engaged the services of the Hawks,” said Motshekga. She added that the Gauteng authority was informed of the leakage and investigators would work on all leads. African News Agency
