Cape Town - Childrens rights group Save the Children SA says an attack on a child is an attack on humanity, as every child&#x2019;s life matters.This after a two-year-old baby girl was raped and burnt with a cigarette, allegedly by her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend, at the weekend.Save the Children SA said on Monday it was horrified by the incident. The girl was rushed to hospital.Police spokesperson Andre Traut said a rape and attempted murder docket was under investigation, and the suspect appeared in the Malmesbury Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Monday.The man, 24, allegedly took the child for a walk and when he returned hours later, he informed the mother she was ill.The mother noticed the child was lame and took her to Malmesbury, before she was transferred to Tygerberg Hospital via helicopter.The man was arrested on Sunday and charged with attempted murder and rape.Save The Children SA advocacy manager Lois Moodley described the incident as &#x201C;horrific&#x201D;, which once again &#x201C;reflects how we have normalised violence againstchildren&#x201D;.She said her organisation believed that &#x201C;violence against children should not be tolerated&#x201D;.Moodley said communities and other child rights organisations need to find solutions to end the violence against children. She said most rape cases against children were under-reported, and cases were sometimes thrown out of court because of a lack of evidence.Moodley said rape perpetrators should be denied bail and locked behind bars, pending the outcome of their court case. In the 2015/16 financial year, 51 895 sexual offences were recorded in the country.The sexual offences&#x2019; rate decreased from 99 percent in 2014/15 to 94.3 percent in 2015/16.This decrease is not a positive sign, according to the Institute for Security Studies.
