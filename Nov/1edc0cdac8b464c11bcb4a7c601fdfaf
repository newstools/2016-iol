Johannebsurg &#x2013; The African National Congress (ANC) on Tuesday said it has decided to constitute a National Working Committee (NWC) delegation to meet with uMkonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) over the party&#x2019;s concerns about the recent utterances by the association.ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe said the party had noted the comments made in the public domain by MKMVA expressing concern about developments within the country and the ruling party.&#x201C;The ANC reiterates our commitment to frank, open and constructive engagement with all parties and individuals who wish to engage and work with us to strengthen the organisation so as to deliver effectively on the aspirations of the South African people,&#x201D; Mantashe told a media briefing after a two-day meeting of the ANC&#x2019;s NWC.&#x201C;Accordingly, the NWC has resolved to constitute itself as a delegation to meet with the veterans who have indicated the need for a platform of engagement.&#x201D;Last week, MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe questioned the struggle credentials of some of the ANC veterans.Meanwhile, Mantashe said the NWC had received a report that the Democratic Alliance would be tabling a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma on Thursday.Mantashe called on ANC representatives in Parliament to &#x201C;once again engage this frivolous motion on the basis of our superior arguments&#x201D; of the ANC-led government in changing the lives of the people.&#x201C;The DA has now made this an annual and frivolous ritual that is fast losing its meaning. At least once a year Parliament must be subjected to discussing a motion of no confidence brought by the DA and with no prospect of succeeding,&#x201D; Mantashe said.&#x201C;The ANC respects the right of any party to invoke Section 89, however, we regard it as a sign of growing arrogance on the part of the opposition that they believe they can command ANC Members of Parliament to vote against the President of the ANC and the Republic.Mantashe said the NWC rejected calls for Zuma to step down following the release of the Public Protector&#x2019;s &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report, saying the calls were &#x201C;premature and unfounded&#x201D;.
