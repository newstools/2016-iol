Durban - An unemployed father of five is walking the KwaZulu-Natal coast in support of the 16 Days of Activism campaign.Jan Mabuyakhulu, 44, of Mtubatuba, set off from Richards Bay on November 21 and hopes to finish his walk in Margate on Friday.He hopes the trek will raise awareness about the need to stop violence against women and children.He was joined by KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, from uMhlanga to Durban North on Sunday. He continued his walk alone on Monday. Mabuyakhulu, who started doing long-distance walks in 2013, hoped the MEC for Health, Sibongiseni Dhlomo, would join him on Tuesday and accompany him to the finishing point. He said he was moved to do the walk after reading many newspaper reports about rapes. When I read about so many cases of raped women and children, I felt the pain and thought I should stand up and do something to fight violence, Mabuyakhulu said. He said he had a dream of building a place of safety for children and women who had been victims of violence and rape. He walks 30km a day, usually setting a brisk pace in the morning before easing up as the day goes by. Mabuyakhulu has asked the public to support him on the walk and with his effort to build a shelter. *Anyone who would like to help can contact Mabuyakhulu at 079 4370 138. Daily News
