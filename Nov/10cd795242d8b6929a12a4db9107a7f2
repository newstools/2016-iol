Johannesburg - The National Union of Mineworkers  (NUM) believes that youngsters need to become more proactive in the workplace and focus on development. During the union's national youth structure conference, the NUM said on Friday the primary focus to enhance youth development. “The development of our youth remains the primary chore of all of us particularly those given a task to lead and indeed the broad mass democratic movement led by the ANC,” said NUM youth structure general secretary Sabelo Mgotywa. During discussions on the  organisational report, Mgotywa encouraged delegates to work hard for a better future. “This will not come easy on a silver platter, we should put more effort for the realisation of our future and the generation to come,” he said. The union made it clear that the youth structure was of utmost importance for the NUM's survival. The union has lost tens of thousands of members, with many of them joining rival union Amcu. The structure said all members were  obligated to ensure the union grows moving forward. @heidigiokos Labour Bureau
