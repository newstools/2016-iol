Parliament - The Division of Revenue Amendment (Dora) Bill was finally passed in the National Assembly (NA) on Tuesday following two failed attempts last week due to the absence of African National Congress (ANC) MPs during the vote.On Tuesday and Wednesday last week, the Dora bill stalled as the NA lacked the quorum of 201 MPs to pass it.On both these days the two biggest opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters walked out leading to only 192 yes votes on Tuesday and 193 on Wednesday.On Thursday last week ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said ill-disciplined ANC MPs who were absent without leave would face a disciplinary hearing.The ANC benches were full on Tuesday. The vote ended with 228 votes in favour of the bill, and 86 voting against the bill. The ANC holds the majority in the 400 member NA with 249 MPs.The DORA bill proposes revisions to the national government equitable share and to conditional grants to provinces and municipalities. Treasury last week warned failure to pass it could affect the provision of services to several government institutions.African News Agency
