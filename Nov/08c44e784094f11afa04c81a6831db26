&#x201C;There are a handful of white families who have owned this country for decades but we&apos;re worried about the Guptas.&#x201D;That&#x2019;s how rapper AKA - real name Kiernan Forbes - began his latest rant - and as an outspoken supporter of the ANC, his words caused some waves on Twitter.The State of Capture report, concerning claims of influence-peddling by the wealthy, politically-connected Gupta family, has roused interest, anxiety and anger in many South Africans - including the controversial rapper.&#x201C;Between the mines, the land, the banks and the media .... They (powerful &#x201C;white families&#x201D;) captured the state a long long time ago,&#x201D; he claimed.The rapper was happy to respond to one of his followers, who agreed with his viewpoint.Veronica Rakoena wrote: &#x201C;And they are probably involved in the Guptas being exposed.. Just to keep people busy and blinded!!&#x201D;To which he responded: &#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;Another fan then responded with some recommended reading on the subject. @Shocctip wrote: &#x201C;get this book&#x201D;. @veronicaRakoena @akaworldwide get this book pic.twitter.com/p3eU5QEIF3 &#x2014; Shocctipp (@Shocctipp) November 3, 2016@veronicaRakoena @akaworldwide get this book pic.twitter.com/p3eU5QEIF3 The rapper then proceeded with a little &#x201C;history lesson&#x201D;.&#x201C;In the final days of Apartheid, R25 BILLION was looted from the state .... Where do you think that money went? ?? Into thin air? The same people who looted that 25 BIllion, are the same people who set the news agenda &amp; run the banks while we sit around and watch OPW,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We&apos;ve had all these black millionaires, black billionaires .... And yet, not one media powerhouse to set OUR agenda. THAT is the problem. You expect those same people to report about them stealing 25 billion at the end of Apartheid .... In THEIR newspapers???? ?? Open your eyes.&#x201D; The Gupta&apos;s did nothing different to what has been going on in our country for decades . Their only flop? They didn&apos;t do it quietly. &#x2014; AKA (@akaworldwide) November 3, 2016The Gupta&apos;s did nothing different to what has been going on in our country for decades . Their only flop?
