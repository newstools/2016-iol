Cape Town - The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Monday announced it has approached the Seshego Equality Court in Limpopo on behalf a transgender high school pupil who had allegedly been harassed, humiliated and discriminated against.In a statement, the SAHRC said the Limpopo Education Department and the school principal had been cited as respondents in the case.&#x201C;The case arises from allegations of humiliation and harassment based on the gender identity of the learner that created a hostile and intimidating environment,&#x201D; the chapter nine institution said in a statement.&#x201C;The proceedings have been instituted to procure relief for alleged unfair discrimination, harassment, and hurtful speech.&#x201D;The Commission said while the Constitution specifically protected the rights of people based on sexual orientation and sexual identity, but when that discrimination was directed at children it was even more shocking.&#x201C;The Commission is of the view that schools have a clear obligation to adopt reasonable measures to avoid painful psychological and sometimes traumatic impact on minor learners,&#x201D; the statement said.&#x201C;In an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality, and freedom, special pains must be taken by all actors in the education sector to ensure these values and rights are protected.&#x201D; African News Agency IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
