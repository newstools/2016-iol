Durban - Violent student protests had led to the sharp spike in crime in the some Durban suburbs, a top police officer has confirmed.Westville residents were left reeling this week after the murder of security company boss Paresh Bodalia, in his home&#x2019;s driveway, during a botched hijacking.In another shocking incident on Wednesday five armed robbers invaded an early-morning prayer meeting at a Pinetown church and robbed the congregation.&#x201C;The gang robbed the worshippers of cash, cellphones, jewellery and two vehicles. No injuries were reported,&#x201D; said Blue Security operations manager Brian Jackson.On Thursday night hundreds of Westville North residents gathered to discuss new measures to improve security in the suburb, including paying extra rates to fund measures like CCTV cameras.On Friday Brigadier Vukani Mgobhozi, deputy cluster commander for Inner and Outer West, blamed the current crime wave on police officers being stretched too thinly because of the need for extra policing at the universities.&#x201C;We almost used everybody (for #feesmustfall),&#x201D; Mgobhozi said. &#x201C;We are still monitoring the situation but we have downscaled,&#x201D; he said without disclosing figures.&#x201C;But it&#x2019;s a gradual downscale.&#x201D;He said Metro Police, private security companies and neighbourhood watch patrols were also part of the intensified security push in the suburbs.Westville&#x2019;s Community Policing Forum (CPF) spokesman Caz Weeks acknowledged that the police station had not had enough men on the ground.The Christmas &#x201C;silly season&#x201D; would also likely see an increase in crime, he added.&#x201C;People will have to become more vigilant. The criminals are aware of people getting 13th cheques, that people have more cash.&#x201D;Mgobhozi added that no police at Westville would be taking leave over the festive season when they would also pay special attention to crime at shopping malls.Meanwhile, top brass met on Friday in Durban at a high-level safety and security meeting with National Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and crime experts to strategise on how to curb rising crime.Nhleko and KZN MEC for transport, community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda, said they were worried about the rise in certain contact crimes, such as murder and assault, in the province.A call went out from the country&#x2019;s top cop and provincial leadership for residents and communities to claim back their streets from criminals, but to not resort to vigilantism.&#x201C;Right across the country, and especially in KZN, my concern is the increase in contact crimes such as murder, attempted murder, assault and grievous body harm. These are worrying crimes because of the impact it has on families. We are focusing on these crimes, but we need the assistance of communities to alert us and work with us to bring crime levels down. The reality is the police cannot be in every home and this is why we need to work together,&#x201D; said Nhleko.He urged residents to mobilise, form neighbourhood watches and analyse crime trends in their areas.&#x201C;This is a good way to tackle crime. I was told of two neighbourhood groups in Randburg that used Whatsapp communication to let each other know what was happening. They said their crime levels decreased because they knew what the issues were in the area.&#x201D; Nhkelo told the crowd of safety and security officials that he was also disturbed to hear about increased incidents of school violence and drug abuse at schools, especially in townships around Durban.&#x201C;I am told that as far afield as Mthwalume, in the south of Durban, our youth are wasting away and sleeping along railway lines, thanks to their addiction to whoonga and other drugs,&#x201D; he said.Nhleko added that he was saddened that there were reports of widespread corruption within the police force.&#x201C;Whether it be on the border posts, or in the taxi industry, or drug trafficking, it is clear that there usually are some police officers who are assisting in criminal activities. Some officers are, in fact, undisclosed shareholders in some of these operations. Each day the Hawks are arresting and seeing these officers all the way to their successful conviction,&#x201D; he said.Kaunda also called on communities to unite and fight crime and said he was concerned about increasing levels of &#x201C;trio crime&#x201D;, which was car-jacking, business and house robbery.&#x201C;The Freedom Charter said the people shall govern, not the criminals shall govern. I call on people to govern themselves, take back their streets and drive criminals away, because the residents are the coalface of the war against crime. Involve yourself in community structures and help fight crime, but do so with the police as we cannot have people taking the law into their own hands,&#x201D; he said.
