Johannesburg - Firebrand Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema told his followers on Monday to seize any piece of white-owned land they wanted, defying a court trying him on charges of inciting violent property grabs.Malema addressed cheering EFF members near the courtroom in Bloemfontein, after a judge adjourned the politically charged hearing.&#x201C;When we leave here, you will see any beautiful piece of land, you like it, occupy it, it belongs to you... It is the land that was taken from us by white people by force through genocide,&#x201D; he said.Malema was appearing in court to face charges of inciting his supporters to take over land during a party meeting in 2014.He faced a similar charge last week of inciting trespass in Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, but that trial was also postponed to let him file an application to the Constitutional Court to scrap an apartheid-era law.After that trial, he called for land grabs &#x201C;without compensation&#x201D;, and added: &#x201C;We are not calling for the slaughter of white people&apos; at least for now&#x201D; - drawing criticism from thethe Democratic Alliance.On Monday, he told his supporters: &#x201C;I will never kill white people, why should I kill them? I will never revenge for what they did ... I&apos;m asking politely for the land to be returned.&#x201D; Reuters
