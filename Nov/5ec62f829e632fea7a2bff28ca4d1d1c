Johannesburg - Renault's refreshed Clio hatch has hit local shores sporting subtle styling revisions inside and out, a new app and an engine upgrade for the base model. After briefly disappearing from the pricelist, the Authentique base model rejoins the range, while the previous version's 55kW 1.2-litre normally aspirated engine makes way for Renault's 66kW/140Nm 898cc three-cylinder turbopetrol - a no-brainer considering its duty-dodging status. The 0.9-litre engine continues to be fitted to Expression and Dynamique models, mated to a five-speed manual gearbox, while Renault's 88kW/190Nm 1.2-litre turbopetrol is still fitted to the Expression EDC, in which case it's paired with a six-speed dual-clutch automated transmission. Renault hasn't made any radical changes to the Clio's already quite striking exterior design, but there is a new bumper design, incorporating a broader upper grille and the headlights have also been restyled. The range-topping Dynamique now boasts full-LED headlights that are said to be 20 percent more powerful than conventional halogen beams, while new C-shaped LED taillights are also fitted. Authentique and Expression models get restyled halogens. Interior revisions Inside the Clio gains some flashier surface materials and upholsteries, a restyled central facia and Expression and Dynamique versions get a redesigned leather-covered steering wheel. If you buy the base Authentique and you're experiencing a bit of Fomo in light of the fact that Renault's touch-screen MediaNav infotainment and navigation system is not fitted, there is an app for that and it's called R&Go. The app uses Bluetooth to connect the user's smart-phone to the car via the radio. With the phone placed in the universal cradle (albeit a smash and grab risk perhaps), owners can access various car and phone functions in one place and use various navigations apps. Alternatively Authentique customers can find another R10 000 for the MediaNav system, which is already fitted as standard to the rest of the range.
