Johannesburg - The human rights and Palestine solidarity organisation, Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), South Africa, has expressed disappointment that the newly-elected Democratic Alliance (DA) Mayor of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba, is reviewing, and has plans to limit the previous administration&#x2019;s human rights and Palestine solidarity efforts at the City of Johannesburg.A newspaper article published over the weekend indicated that Mashaba on behalf of Johannesburg was now reconsidering its links with the Palestinian city of Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank.Relations between one of South Africa&#x2019;s largest cities and Palestine were forged between 2014 and 2015 under former African National Congress (ANC) Mayor, Parks Tau.&#x201C;Instead of proving their critics wrong, South Africa&#x2019;s opposition party, the DA, has done exactly the opposite,&#x201D; said BDS spokesperson Kwara Kekana on Tuesday.But Mashaba has hit back, accusing BDS of sensation-seeking, and said his primary focus was on improving the lives of the citizens of Johannesburg.In August already ANC Regional Secretary Dada Morero warned that: &#x201C;Under our ANC leadership, we signed an MOU agreement between the City of Johannesburg and the Palestinian city of Ramallah.&#x201C;We also donated a statute of President Nelson Mandela to our Palestinian counterparts which our then Mayor Tau Parks inaugurated earlier this year,&#x201D; said Morero.&#x201C;This very MOU with Palestine&#x2019;s Ramallah and solidarity with the Palestinian people may now be in jeopardy under the DA; in addition, our fear extends to other progressive pro-poor policies that were put in place in the last decade now being reversed by the DA.&#x201D;Morero also said that Mashaba appointed a pro-Israeli sympathiser, Rabelani Dagada, as his MMC for Finance.&#x201C;As South Africans and those involved in international solidarity efforts we are shocked that Herman Mashaba used an important South African Government-hosted visit of a high level Palestinian delegation to indicate, at this early stage, his intention to review Johannesburg&#x2019;s Palestine agreement,&#x201D; said Kekana&#x201C;We hope that despite the pressure of the Israeli lobby that Mashaba will rethink his current anti-Palestine approach.&#x201C;We trust that the ANC caucus and other progressive parties will fight this stance in the Johannesburg Council and ensure that the Palestine agreement is not undermined by the DA coalition government in Johannesburg.&#x201D;However, Mashaba hit back in a statement sent to the African News Agency (ANA).&#x201C;I note with concern the statement released by BDS on Tuesday,&#x201D; said Mashaba.&#x201C;BDS has used hearsay evidence from a news article and comments made by the ANC back in August to try and give credibility to the allegations in their statement.&#x201C;At the same time, BDS has made no effort whatsoever to verify these comments with me or my office. This should go a long way in showing the real intentions of BDS in releasing a sensationalist article,&#x201D; said Mashaba.&#x201C;I met with the Mayor of Ramallah, Mr Mousa Hadid and the Palestine Minister of Local Government, Dr Hussein Alaraj on November 9, as I have done with many other mayors and ambassadors from across the world.&#x201C;This was a courtesy visit by Mayor Hadid and afforded me an opportunity to discuss my vision for the City of Johannesburg. The meeting was both cordial and respectful, there was no hostility from either of us.&#x201C;During our meeting I also informed the Mayor of Ramallah, as I have done with all other Mayors I have met, that it is the early days of our new administration and our current focus is on addressing the domestic challenges faced in our City.&#x201C;It was indicated that we would turn our attention in a more focused manner on international relationships in the early part of 2017.&#x201C;My priority is finding solutions to the unemployment of over 800 000 residents; the plight of our residents living in 180 informal settlements, many of whom do not have access to even the most basic of services; the over R200 billion infrastructure backlog in our City; and deep rooted corruption in government which steals from the poor and hampers our ability to deliver service to our people,&#x201D; said Mashaba.&#x201C;My approach to our international relationships will be defined by who we can work with to achieve real solutions to our very real challenges.&#x201C;This is the responsible thing to do. Catering for the urgent needs of our people at home instead of grandstanding on the international arena, trying to achieve internationally what we are unable to achieve for our residents at home.&#x201D; African News Agency IOL on Twitter IOL News on Facebook
