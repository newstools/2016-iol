Nairobi - The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)  announced a reduction in entry fees to wildlife sanctuaries in the country as part of an incentive to boost tourism. A KWS statement said the reduced parks entry fee would be effective from November 1 to reflect a 16 percent value added tax (VAT) exemption announced early this year by President Uhuru Kenyatta to stimulate the growth of the tourism sector. “The parks entry fees have been revised downwards and are now capped at 60 (US) dollars and 8.6 dollars for foreign adult visitors and adult Kenyan citizens respectively,” said the statement. Entry fees to “premium national parks” have been reduced from $90 to $60 over a two-year period, according to the statement. “We expect Kenyan game parks and reserves to be competitive in the region and globally thus attracting a bigger number of domestic and foreign tourists,” it added. Kenya's iconic wildlife-related tourism contributes 70 percent of the revenue from tourism. The KWS says in the statement it is keen to open up less visited parks that it considers “untapped hidden gems.” The Kenyan government has partnered with investors to encourage visits to wildlife parks by setting up more lodging facilities. The KWS also says that revenue generated from national parks tourism is channelled towards the protection of wildlife. Xinhua
