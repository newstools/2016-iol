New York - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday sacked the commander of the UN force in South Sudan after a report concluded that it failed to protect civilians during an outbreak of violence from July 8 to 11.A UN special investigation found that the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) &quot;did not respond effectively to the violence due to an overall lack of leadership, preparedness and integration among the various components of the mission&quot;.The UN chief &quot;asked for the immediate replacement of the force commander,&quot; Lieutenant General Johnson Mogoa Kimani Ondieki of Kenya, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said at a press conference.&quot;The force did not operate under a unified command, resulting in multiple and sometimes conflicting orders to the four troop contingents from China, Ethiopia, Nepal and India, and ultimately underusing the more than 1,800 infantry troops at [UN headquarters],&quot; according to the investigation.On July 11, South Sudanese government soldiers went on a rampage in a compound in the capital Juba housing about 50 employees of international organisations.The soldiers killed a journalist belonging to the same ethnic group as rebel leader Riek Machar, raped or gang-raped several foreign women, beat up dozens of staff and looted the compound, according to a Human Rights Watch report.In the three days of violence at least 73 people were killed.UNMISS has 16,000 troops deployed in South Sudan, which has been at war since December 2013.Sexual violence against women has been a general feature of the military power struggle that has pitted President Salva Kiir against Machar.The military conflict has killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people.Kiir and Machar formed a unity government in April, but renewed violence and the sacking of Machar from the post of vice president dashed hopes of peace. dpa IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
