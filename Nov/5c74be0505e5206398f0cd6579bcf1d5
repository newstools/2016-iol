By: IOL Motoring Staff Johannesburg - Toyota's latest-generation Fortuner has barely been with us for a year and Toyota is already treating it to an upgrade of sorts. Leather and alloys For starters, leather seat trim is now fitted to the base 2.4 GD-6 and 2.7 VVTi versions too, making it standard across the range. The aforementioned 2.8 GD-6 and 4.0 V6, which already had leather as standard, also receive a spec boost in the form of new 18-inch alloy wheels, which replace the previous 17-inch rims. The 2.4 GD-6 and 2.7 VVTi continue to roll on 17-inch 'dual rib' alloys. The Fortuner range remains otherwise unchanged, powered by a four-engine line-up consisting of two turbodiesels (110kW/400Nm 2.4 GD-6 and 130kW/420-450Nm 2.8 GD-6) and two normally aspirated petrols (122kW/245Nm 2.7 VVTi and 175kW/376Nm 4.0 V6).
