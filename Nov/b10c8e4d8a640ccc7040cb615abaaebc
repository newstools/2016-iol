London - Germany&#x2019;s European Commissioner has refused to apologise for describing Chinese people as &#x2018;slitty eyed&#x2019;.Gunther Oettinger used the derogatory German term &#x2018;schlitzaugen&#x2019; during an after-dinner speech in Hamburg in which he mocked Chinese ministers who had visited Brussels.A secretly filmed video of his speech (scroll down to view) that was posted online also shows Oettinger joking that German MPs would make gay marriage mandatory.Describing the visiting Chinese businessmen, he said the congregation consisted of &quot;nine men, one party, and no democracy&quot;, Reuters reports.&quot;All of them in suits, single-breasted, dark blue jackets,&quot; he added. &quot;All of them had their hair combed from left to right, with black shoe polish on their hair.&quot;In an interview with German newspaper Die Welt, Oettinger defended his comments. &quot;That was a somewhat sloppy remark that was in no way meant to be disrespectful to China,&quot; he said.He added: &quot;You have to see the broader context in which I made my remarks. In my speech, I wanted to warn Germany of too much self-confidence.&quot;In his speech, Mr Oettinger also joked about gay marriage. After criticising Germany&apos;s welfare system and Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s liberal policies, he said &quot;perhaps compulsory gay marriage will be introduced&quot;.A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that his remarks showed that some Western politicians &quot;harbour an irritating feeling of superiority.&quot;&quot;We hope that they learn to see others as equal and treat them with respect,&quot; she added.His remarks were criticised by the German Federation of Lesbians and Gays (LSVD). LSVD spokeswoman Stefanie Schmidt said: &quot;An EU commissioner must be able to convincingly represent the European values of non-discrimination and not put the case for racist and homophobic prejudices.&quot;The Duke of Edinburgh was embroiled in a similar controversy in 1986 when he told a group of British exchange students during an official visit to China: &#x2018;If you stay here much longer you&#x2019;ll all be slitty eyed.&#x2019;Daily Mail, The Independent, dpa IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
