Cape Town - Authorities at Pollsmoor Prison are battling chronic overcrowding.Over 8 900 inmates are squashed into a facility built to accommodate 3 900.Last week, a delegation from the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services, along with members of the NCOP&#x2019;s select committee on security and justice, visited the prison to get an update.Former Correctional Services Inspecting Judge Edwin Cameron had earlier written a damning report on conditions.Accompanying the MPs was Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha, and his deputy Thabang Makwetla, along with Department of Correctional Services commissioner Zach Modise, and provincial commissioner Delekile Klaas.At Pollsmoor&apos;s female section, there are 692 inmates, some with babies, 341 awaiting trial with only 392 beds.

The sections are named after areas such as Mitchells Plain, Blue Downs and Khayelitsha.
