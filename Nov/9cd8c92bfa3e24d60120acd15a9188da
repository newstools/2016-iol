Nairobi - Kenya on Sunday dismissed a United Nations report linking its troops to illicit charcoal trade from a port under their control in Somalia.State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu condemned the allegation &quot;in the strongest terms possible,&quot; terming it &quot;hogwash masquerading as research.&quot;The Kenyan troops are part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is helping the Somali government battle terror group Al-Shabaab.&quot;We are focused on the job that took us to Somalia in the first place, and will not be distracted by the latest hogwash masquerading as research,&quot; Esipisu told journalists in Nairobi.A UN Monitoring Group report, published by a Kenyan daily on Sunday, said Kenyan troops in Somalia received fees for allowing illicit exports of charcoal from the port of Kismayu. The report said the Kenyan troops received US$2 per bag of charcoal at Kismayu, citing charcoal industry and non-governmental organisation sources.The report estimated that up to 6 million bags of charcoal had been exported annually from Kismayu and Buur Gaabo, another port adjacent to a Kenyan army base in Somalia.Charcoal exports were banned by the UN Security Council in 2012 in an effort to cut off funding for Al-Shabaab.Esipisu said the UN report appeared as a regurgitation of reports NGOs have issued over time, with the sole agenda of &quot;demoralizing&quot; Kenyan troops.Last week, Kenya was angered by the UN chief&apos;s dismissal of Kenyan Lt. General Johnson Kimani Ondieki as the commander of the UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan.Xinhua IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
