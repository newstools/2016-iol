Johannesburg - Labour federation Fedusa has elected Godfrey Selematsela, president of  public sector union Hospersa, as Its new president following its two-day national congress on Friday. Selematsela’s appointment follows the stepping down of  its president Koos Bezuidenhout, who served in the position for 20 years. The federation, which is second biggest in the country, held its congress in Joburg on Friday under the theme “decent work and decent life for all”. Selematsela said that over the past couple over years the labour movement has faced a number of challenges and threats to the collective bargaining, which his federation was able to overcome. One such threat was the court action brought by the Free Market Foundation which sort to amend  the Labour Minister’s powers to extend collective bargaining agreements to non-parties. Selematsela said the proposals being discussed at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on the national minimum wage and labour stability could only lead to the upliftment of workers in the country. Earlier at the congress, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said social partners would be meeting at Nedlac on Sunday to get feedback from the national minimum wage advisors panel on their final report. Ramaphosa also called on business, labour and the government to continue talks on finding solutions to slow economic growth and job creation. Selematsela said he hoped to continue with the conference’s theme for “decent work and life for all” while in office. The federation’s other office bearer positions were unopposed. @ZintleMahlati Labour Bureau
