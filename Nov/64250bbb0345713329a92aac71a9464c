Cape Town President Jacob Zuma announced on Friday that he will take the remedial action contained in the State of Capture report of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on judicial review. The President has considered and also sought legal advice on the contents of the report as well as the remedial action to be taken, the Presidency said. The legal advice given and which advice has been accepted by the President is to take the remedial action on review. In her report on state capture by the wealthy Gupta family, who is close to Zuma, Madonsela recommended that the president establish a commission of inquiry into state capture, but said judge chairing the inquiry must be chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.Madonsela said the inquiry has to be completed within six months, while flagging instances where Zuma may have flouted the law and calling on the National Prosecuting Authority and the police to probe possible cause for criminal charges contained in the report.The presidency statement said the basis for his actions will be set out in the judicial review application. The legal team on brief is currently working on the review application to be served and filed within the time periods prescribed by the law, the statement said. The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 provides that any proceedings for judicial review must be instituted without unreasonable delay and not later than 180 days from the date that the reviewable action was concluded.
