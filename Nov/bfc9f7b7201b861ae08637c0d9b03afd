DUNCAN GUY  Durban - Petrol attendants see a great deal, but staff at a Glenwood garage were amazed to see one of their petrol pumps being dragged along behind a car after a motorist fled without paying for fuel. Owner of Bulwer Park Service Station, Tony Ball, had high praise for his quick-thinking petrol attendant who switched off the pump seconds before the driver sped away. An off-duty police officer driving by gave chase and arrested the driver shortly after Monday’ s incident. Had a spark from the metal casing of the pump ignited the fuel, there could have been a tragedy. Fortunately the only fuel was what had been in the hose. The pump eventually came loose from the car’ s fuel tank. Ball said the nozzle had to be placed at a specific angle for it to drag the entire pump with it. Normally the nozzle would have sheared from the pipe. “I am not aware of this and I have been in the petrol industry 35 years,” said Viv Corinalbi, acting director of the South African Petroleum Retailers’  Association. The driver and his accomplice have already appeared in court. Ball has pledged to do all he can to make sure they land in prison. “Criminals are exploiting all this ubuntu and stuff. I want to send out an urgent message to them not to try this sh*t.” He said the car’ s licence disc showed a different registration number to the number plates, suggesting that the driver had intended to steal petrol. The alert attendant, Lancelot Duze, suspicious of the driver, had asked him to pay using his bank card while petrol was being dispensed. “Thank goodness he turned off the pump, or there would have been a disaster,” said Ball. Corinalbi said petrol theft by motorists driving off without paying was not common, but dragging the pump was a unique case. “Having petrol attendants... rather than self-service, helps a lot,” he said.
