Lagos, Nigeria - A cross-dressing social media star dubbed &quot;Africa's male Barbie&quot; has shot to fame in Nigeria, sparking a charged debate in a conservative country where alternative lifestyles remain frowned upon.Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, who goes by the name Bobrisky on SnapChat, makes his living selling 100,000 naira (about R4 500) skin-whitening creams while chronicling online his life of luxury in Lagos.But Bobrisky really went viral in late October, when an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari and a marketing executive pulled out of appearing with him on a social media panel in Abuja, the nation's capital.&quot;The inclusion of Bobrisky unfortunately sensationalises and radicalises what should otherwise be a serious discourse on new approaches to media engagement,&quot; said Alder Consulting, whose social media executive withdrew.Meanwhile, Buhari's social media aide Bashir Ahmad said he would be &quot;unavailable for the event&quot;.Embracing the mantra of every successful reality star - there's no such thing as bad publicity - Bobrisky went ahead with the talk.&quot;The organisers invited me to speak on the fact that people are talking about Bobrisky,&quot; the 25-year-old told AFP, characteristically referring to himself in the third person.&quot;Them withdrawing wasn't nice. In Nigeria, the majority of people here judge you so fast,&quot; added Bobrisky, who recounts online how his lifestyle is funded by a rich, mystery man he refers to only as &quot;bae.&quot;&quot;We are in this life once, people should be given the freedom to express themselves.&quot;Bobrisky has earned himself a reputation for being a rebel.It's a dangerous reputation in a country where in 2014, former president Goodluck Jonathan signed the same-sex marriage prohibition bill, forbidding not only marriage, but same-sex cohabitation and any &quot;public show of same-sex amorous relationship&quot; with penalties ranging from 10 to 14 years in prison.But Bobrisky, who gets over 150,000 views on each video he posts, insisted his appeal isn't because he's a civil rights crusader.&quot;People love the fact that I'm real,&quot; he said, speaking at his apartment in Lekki, an upmarket suburb in Nigeria's commercial hub.&quot;It's about the way I dance, because I'm a very good dancer, and my makeup.&quot;Bobrisky has a slight build, with a close crop of black hair he wears in gelled curls. He's wearing red sweatpants with a Mickey Mouse cartoon embroidered near a pocket and a hot pink mesh tanktop as he gets ready for a night out in his small living room, decorated with gold and black wallpaper and a crystal chandelier.&quot;I'm doing a party look, a diva look,&quot; he said as he applies the first out of many layers of foundation, explaining that he was 12 when he first experimented with makeup. &quot;I liked my mom's look,&quot; he said with a demure smile.He finishes his makeup by gluing gold glitter on the inside corner of his eyes near the tear ducts, the sparkling beginning of a swooping cat eye even Cleopatra would envy.&quot;Beauty is pain,&quot; he said, wincing as he applies the chemical glue, &quot;but this is the one that holds the glitter on the longest.&quot;Bobrisky is the exception in Nigeria.Although no one has yet been charged under the 2014 same-sex marriage law, it has led to &quot;real fear and abuse&quot;, said Wendy Isaack, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who wrote an October report on the issue.&quot;It created opportunities for the police and members of the public to engage in extortion and get money from people they believe to be LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender),&quot; Isaack said.&quot;If you pass a law that leads to violence with impunity, you're creating a situation where there's lack of respect for rule of law in Nigeria, and that's not helpful,&quot; Isaack said.Still, Bobrisky says he &quot;doesn't bother&quot; with the haters and instead is focussing on launching a YouTube channel where he'll do makeup tutorials.It's exactly that born-this-way defiance that endears him to fans.&quot;He doesn't have to take on a leadership role,&quot; said Olumide Femi Makanjuola, deputy director of The Initiative for Equal Rights, a Nigeria-based non-profit organisation advocating for LGBT rights.&quot;People like Bobrisky are creating the conversation. They didn't start out to be an activist, but it happened. That's one of the powerful things of pop culture.&quot;Transvestites are almost non-existent in Nigeria, while gays are regularly the victims of violence.AFP
