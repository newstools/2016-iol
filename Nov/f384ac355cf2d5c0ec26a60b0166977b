Janet Jackson has reportedly converted to Islam. The 50-year-old singer is expecting her first child with her husband Wissam Al Mana - whom she wed in secret in 2012 - and her friends believe she has undergone a full conversion to the religion which Wissam himself practices. A source told The Sun newspaper: "When she's visiting Wissam's family in the Middle East she wears no make-up, no hair extensions and keeps to traditional Muslim clothing. "She feels like she has found a home with her new religion. She has spent a great deal of time studying it." And the news comes as a stark change for the 'Rhythm Nation' hitmaker, who previously appeared topless on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine, and suffered a "wardrobe malfunction" at the 2004 Super Bowl when Justin Timberlake ripped off part of her outfit which exposed her nipple. The source added: "The days of raunchy dance moves and sexual lyrics are long gone." Meanwhile, the loved-up couple have already began discussing names for their baby. A source said: "Her support system is extremely strong. She is taking things easy these days and is feeling well but not overdoing it in any capacity of her life. Janet is staying healthy for her and her baby. "She's been praying for a child for a very long time. She's already in the process of thinking of baby names." Another source added that the pregnancy was "the best thing" to happen to the 'Love Will Never Do' singer. They said: "Janet is super excited. She's doing great. Janet feels really strong and is just so excited for the baby to come. She feels like this is one of the best things ever to happen to her."  Bang Showbiz
