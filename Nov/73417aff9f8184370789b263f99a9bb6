Pretoria - The family of 25-year-old Neo Rasehwete, who was beaten and stabbed to death at a pub in Ga-Rankuwa, on Monday called for an end to corruption within their local police service and magistrate&#x2019;s court, saying this was denying justice.According to the family, rampant corruption had led to a delay in prosecuting those responsible for the brutal murder of Rasehwete last year.He was allegedly beaten and stabbed to death on June 14 last year while out with friends at the Vertigo pub in Ga-Rankuwa Zone 1.His father, Mike, said they had asked the local EFF branch to help them as the court was reneging on its duties in ensuring justice and prosecuting those responsible for the murder. &#x201C;The prosecutor wants to withdraw the case without giving us any explanation. He claims there is no evidence to support the case,&#x201D; Rasehwete snr said.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s painful as a parent to lose a child who we had hoped would have a prosperous future. All we want at the moment is for him to get the justice he deserves.&#x201D;Trevor Moloisane, EFF leader in Ward 30, said the family sought their help as they feared the police and the courts were not handling the matter correctly.Moloisane said the case had been dragging on for a very long time without anyone providing the family with solid information.&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve done our research and most of the people here do not trust the police and the courts and alleged there is a lot of corruption going on.&#x201D;He said the family had been &#x201C;to hell and back&#x201D; without getting any answers or explanations on the numerous postponements of the case.&#x201C;On the one hand, you have the investigating officer saying he has enough evidence, but the courts say they are looking to provisionally withdraw the matter,&#x201D; he said.Rasehwete&#x2019;s mother, Thandiwe Leburu, said the most painful thing for her was witnessing the man accused of killing her son getting out on bail of R500.&#x201C;I still don&#x2019;t understand how someone can be released on R500 bail while they are facing a murder charge.&#x201C;We even had to go to SAPS provincial to report the matter after the local police wanted to let go of the case,&#x201D; she said.Duke Moche, also of the EFF, said even when applying to demonstrate, court representatives were not conversant with the sections of the law that governed public demonstrations and gatherings. &#x201C;This is just one indication of why the local people do not trust the police and the courts. There is no understanding of the law they are meant to enforce and that is why the community are struggling to get justice,&#x201D; said Moche.The SAPS had yet to comment on the allegations made by the family.The matter was postponed to February 3.
