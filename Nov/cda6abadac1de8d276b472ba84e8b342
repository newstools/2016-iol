Pretoria - The Tshwane Metro Police has said all its systems are ready for the expected protests by different political parties and civic society groups which is set to bring Pretoria CBD to a standstill on Wednesday.On Tuesday, Tshwane Metro Police Department spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said the pickets and marches in the city centre had all been approved and would be closely monitored.&#x201C;We are ready. Remember these are our departmental operations. If it comes to a push, we&#x2019;re ready to withdraw our other members from other regions to come and assist us here,&#x201D; Mahamba said outside the High Court in Pretoria where a full bench of judges was hearing President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s application to interdict former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s report on &#x201C;state capture&#x201D;.&#x201C;It is not only us as the TMPD who are going to be responsible for those pickets. We are having our counterparts, the South African Police Service and Gauteng Traffic Police &#x2026; all the law enforcement agencies will be here tomorrow (Wednesday). It&#x2019;s our joint effort, not a TMPD issue alone.&#x201D;Hundreds of Economic Freedom Fighters supporters were picketing along Madiba Street, adjacent to the court on Tuesday, and they vowed to return to the same area on Wednesday.&#x201C;We are here to fight state capture which has allowed Jacob Zuma to loot every resource from this country. We are poor citizens of this country and our lives would have been better if we had another president,&#x201D; said Saesha Nkomo from Mamelodi, east of Pretoria.&#x201C;We cannot find jobs. We cannot afford university fees. The ANC government wants us to survive by selling our bodies. We will not do that. We&#x2019;re here to fight that system which oppresses us.&#x201D;Another EFF supporter, Thabiso Ntlekwa, said he would join the street protest &#x201C;for as long as it takes to be heard&#x201D;.&#x201C;If it means we have to sleep outside this court, we will. How much more do we need to be doing to get Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s attention? Jewellery doesn&#x2019;t listen. He is trying to cover up his corruption by coming to court.&#x201D;The often busy Madiba Street outside the courthouse was blocked to traffic. The EFF supporters in their signature red regalia were waving placards on which was written &#x201C;Defend the Democratic State&#x201D; and &#x201C;Fees Must Fall&#x201D;.Mahamba said the picket on Tuesday had been peaceful.&#x201C;It is still peaceful and we anticipate that it is going to remain like this,&#x201D; he said.The TMPD was urging motorists to avoid areas in the vicinity of the Church Square in the city centre on Wednesday.&#x201C;The marches are scheduled to start at 8am at the Church Square before heading to the court. The picketers may leave the Pretoria Magistrate&#x2019;s Court at around 2pm. People working in and around the CBD should implement measures to minimise the inconvenience. They can come to work earlier than the march. Most streets are going to be closed in the CBD,&#x201D; said Mahamba. African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
