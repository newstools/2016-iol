Caitlyn Jenner has announced her new memoir will be called 'The Secrets of My Life'. The 67-year-old television personality, who was previously known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing gender reassignment surgery, took to Twitter on Monday night (28.11.16) to reveal the title of her upcoming memoir, as well as telling fans the book will hit shelves on April 25 2017. Caitlyn uploaded a picture of a pink rippling background which featured the text: “The Secrets of My Life. On sale April 25 2017. http://caitlynjenner.com (sic)” Alongside the photo, the 'I Am Cait' star wrote: “Excited to share this with you all :) (sic)” Posting the same picture on her Instagram account, Caitlyn captioned the photo with a love heart emoji. The 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star first announced she was working on the memoir in January this year, and said the story would detail her “journey from Bruce to Caitlyn, and her brave transition into womanhood.” In a statement, she said at the time: “Things have been moving so quickly that it will be nice to slow things down a bit and take the proper time to reflect on this journey. “I couldn't pick a better team, in Grand Central and Buzz [Bissinger], to make sure this story is told with a lot of honesty and care.” Meanwhile, Caitlyn recently opened up about how her youngest daughters - Kendall and Kylie Jenner - found her transition easier to accept when they saw the support she was getting on social media. She said: “[Supporters] were all just going crazy on social media. “I think at that point it made my two little girls, who obviously live in that world - I think it made them feel really good. “Like, 'You know what? It's going to be OK. People still love my daddy.'“  Bang Showbiz
