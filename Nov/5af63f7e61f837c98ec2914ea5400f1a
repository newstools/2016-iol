 Cape Town - A raid on a farm in Caledon in the Overberg area on Friday morning led officers to a stash of abalone worth around R6.5 million, Western Cape police said. “Our endeavours to break the back of abalone poaching in the Western Cape have led members of Provincial Detectives to a farm in Caledon early this morning (Friday) where 35 891 pieces of abalone with an estimated street value of R6.5 million and abalone drying equipment were confiscated,” a statement said. There was no one present at the farm, but police said they were not excluding the possibility of arrests during their investigation into how the abalone came to be at the farm. “We will continue with our stern stance against the lucrative marine resources trade and will pursue every avenue in this regard.” African News Agency
