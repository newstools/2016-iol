Parliament - Parliament&#x2019;s Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence on Tuesday shortlisted ten candidates for the long-vacant post of Inspector General of Intelligence.Clinton Davids, Isaac Dintwe, Jay Govender, Smanga Jele, Andile Kilifele, Petrus Nchabeleng, Nhlanhla Ngidi, Nhlakanipho Mkontwana, Nyelisali Tshitereke and Bruce Watson were chosen by MPs from a list of 17 nominees.Among the nominees was African National Congress (ANC) security hawk Cecil Burgess, whom the ruling party had favoured for the post but twice failed to secure enough votes in the National Assembly for the two-thirds majority to seal his appointment.In May, the ruling party abandoned a last-ditch attempt to drive his appointment through Parliament after it became clear it could not win any support from opposition parties to give it an additional 18 votes required and the standing committee was instructed to begin the process anew.On Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance objected to his inclusion on the shortlist and the ANC did not press the point.The inspector general of intelligence is the civilian watchdog body providing oversight over the intelligence community. The post has been empty for nearly two years since the departure of Faith Radebe. African News Agency IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
