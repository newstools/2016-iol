Washington - US President Barack Obama pledged on Wednesday to work for a smooth transition of power with president-elect Donald Trump, the Republican winner of Tuesday&apos;s election, who has promised to undo Obama&apos;s top domestic and foreign policy initiatives.In brief remarks to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Obama urged fellow Democrats to put aside their disappointment and tried to strike a positive tone after a devastating electoral defeat.&#x201C;It is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences,&#x201D; Obama said with a smile about Trump, who had long questioned whether Obama had been born in the United States and his eligibility for office.&#x201C;We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country,&#x201D; Obama said.Obama and his wife, Michelle, campaigned hard for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to defeat Trump, acknowledging that the president&apos;s legacy on healthcare, climate change and financial reforms were on the line.But Obama kept his remarks on Wednesday focused on ensuring a successful transition for Trump, noting that his Republican predecessor, former President George W. Bush, had done the same for him eight years ago.&#x201C;Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we&apos;re actually all on one team,&#x201D; Obama said.&#x201C;I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we&apos;re all on the same team,&#x201D; Obama said.
