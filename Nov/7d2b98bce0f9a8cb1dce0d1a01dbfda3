Cape Town - A night out with his colleagues ended with a UCT student being dragged out of a metered taxi and beaten up, all because he had argued with the cab driver over what he thought was an extortionate fare.Samuel, 22, says he is still fearful and asked that his last name not be used after his violent encounter in the early hours of Friday morning while he was headed to his home in Fairways.He works part-time at a pizza parlour while studying towards a degree in civil engineering.He said on Thursday he met up with some of his colleagues for drinks after work.&#x201C;I don&apos;t usually go to Claremont, but the guys wanted to go out because we don&apos;t usually socialise as colleagues,&#x201D; said Samuel.They all had drinks, and at the end of the night headed home separately.He would usually use a taxi hailing service, but by the end of the night the battery on his phone was dead and he had no choice but to use the metered taxis parked in Claremont Main Road, near the bars and clubs.Samuel got into a taxi and saw a meter on the dashboard.&#x201C;As we were driving he told me it would cost me R300. I argued with him, saying I would not pay it because the trip from Claremont to my house in Fairways never cost more than R100.&#x201C;I told him his demand for R300 was ridiculous and that I would not pay,&#x201D; said Samuel.Samuel estimates about 800 metres from his home, the cab driver stopped.&#x201C;I didn&apos;t say anything. He pulled open the front passenger door where I was seated and dragged me out, punching and kicking me,&#x201D; said Samuel.He passed out, and when he eventually woke he says he was bloodied and in pain and walked the rest of the way home.His new Samsung Galaxy S7 cellphone was missing.He opened a case at the Grassy Park police station, and police have confirmed that they are investigating.While suspects have been identified, police have yet to make an arrest.
