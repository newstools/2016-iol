Durban - The father of a Grade 8 pupil who was allegedly assaulted by his teacher, said an out-of-court settlement was definitely not an option .He was reacting to the outcome of the Durban high school teacher s brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate s Court on Tuesday. The teacher, school and the 13-year-old pupil cannot be named to protect the identity of the boy.The Daily News reported in October that the teacher allegedly grabbed the schoolboy, choked him and threw him to the floor in class.The school reported the 53-year-old teacher to the Department of Education and the boy s father reported the incident to the South African Council of Educators (SACE).The boy s father said the incident happened two days before the close of term, in September, and the teacher had not been at school since.In the letter to the council, the father had detailed the incident, saying his son had packed his bag and was about to leave the class when the teacher apparently slammed the door shut, and told him he was not leaving.When his son apparently tried to walk back to his desk, he was allegedly grabbed by the teacher from the back of his neck, choked around the neck and thrown to the floor.The father said the class pupils started screaming and the prefects from a nearby classroom came to investigate and rescued his son.The teacher was summoned to appear in court on a charge of assault, and was released on warning.On Tuesday, the matter was adjourned until next month for possible ADR, or alternative dispute resolution. This generally refers to the two parties discussing the matter so that it could be settled out of court.Speaking afterwards, the father was upset to hear this outcome, and said they were not consulted and would definitely not agree to this. This is absolute nonsense, he said. I don t want the charges to be dropped, and for this to happen to another child.The father said he was visited by a representative from SACE, who took his statement for their investigation.SACE spokesman Themba Ndhlovu could not comment on the matter on Tuesday.The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education spokesman, Sicelo Khuzwayo, said the department was still investigating the matter. The teacher is currently on sick leave.The schoolboy finished writing his last exam paper for the school year on Tuesday, and has attended counselling sessions with Childline. He s now doing a little better. For the first two to three weeks, he was very quiet and withdrawn. Now that exams are over, I m sure he ll be doing better, said his father.[email&#160;protected]@noelenebDaily News
