Swinburne, Free State - The N3 Gateway has much to offer, from mountain biking, fishing, trail running and hiking to heritage tourism, arts and crafts, secluded retreats, health spas, wedding and team building venues. Go to www.n3gateway.com and discover the region’s joys. The route stretches from Pretoria in the north to the Valley of a Thousand Hills in the south, traversing four provinces: KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. The region incorporates cross-border tourism with Lesotho through Phuthaditjhaba, Caledonspoort and the Sani Pass, and includes the Battlefields Route to Newcastle. You can’t talk about Riverview Country Inn without also considering the village of Swinburne, as they have risen out of the ashes of the past together. Rensburg Kop is a well-known landmark alongside the N3 and, to many travellers, a welcome opportunity for a rest and food stop on the journey to and from the coast. However, nestled below this towering rock, and beside the Wilge River, is the village of Swinburne. Surrounding it is a network of country roads for the adventure-seekers. (Quads, mountain biking, lions, hiking, fishing, birding, game drives and off-roading are all available.) Riverview, with its Hound & Hare pub and restaurant, has become a popular stop for home-cooked meals and overnight accommodation: a relaxed alternative to the regular eateries along the N3.
