Johannesburg - The Tshwane University of Technology is adamant that final examinations will get underway on Monday, despite ongoing disruptions by &#x2018;FeesMustFall&#x2019; protesters at its campuses.The university said it took a decision to move the final examinations to the Tshwane Events Centre following disruptions at the Soshanguve campus on Thursday. Transport to and from the venue would be provided.&#x201C;Students will have to produce a student card and personalised final exam timetable before they will be allowed to utilise the transport provided. Security measures at all the university campuses, including the distant campuses in eMalahleni, Mbombela and Polokwane will be reinforced. The SAPS have been engaged to remain on standby during the examination period,&#x201D; TUT management said.Four students were subsequently suspended on Thursday, for contravening a court interdict in Soshanguve, the institution said.Students at the Pretoria, Arts and Arcadia campuses would also write their main examinations at the Tshwane Events Centre, while Ga-Rankuwa campus students would sit for their exams at the Grace Bible Church.Last month, the university&#x2019;s council announced that there would be no tuition fee increase for the 2017 academic year, and that no student would be excluded from academic programmes because of fees owed.
