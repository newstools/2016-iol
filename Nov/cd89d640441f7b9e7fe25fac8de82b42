Moscow - US president-elect Donald Trump has accused the media of stirring up protest action against him following his victory in the elections. "Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!" Trump wrote on Twitter. On Wednesday, Trump's opponents gathered in various US states and in such major cities as New York, Chicago and Seattle to express their opposition to Trump's victory in the elections. And on Thursday, demonstrators took to the streets across the country for a second day,  voicing fears that his Trump's victory would strike a blow against civil rights. On Wednesday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton conceded election defeat to Trump, who gained well above the 270 electoral votes needed for a victory in the Tuesday elections. On Thursday, Trump met with President Barack Obama and leaders in Congress to begin the process of transferring power from the current administration to its successor, which takes office in January. Commenting on the meeting, Trump wrote on Twitter "A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania [Trump's wife] liked Mrs. O a lot!"
