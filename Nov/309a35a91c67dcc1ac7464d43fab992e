His brother Ntsika links with Mda on vocals. “The new album is different in respect of the detail in the stories we tell. We focused on the social and political aspects of Kofifi, and the resilience of the people who were forcibly removed. They lost loved ones and material possessions, but they still had their music and their spiritual drive,” said Ntsika. “We are paying homage to the inspiration this generation gave us, and we draw a lot of influence from the music of that time – Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba – and we’ve brought the atmosphere from the smoky pubs where comrades, journalists and friends would meet to discuss the South Africa they visualised, into the studio with us. We wanted to paint a picture through our music.” Event Information: Venue: La Parada, 107 Bree St, Cape Town City Centre Date: 30 November 2016 Time: 18:30 for 19:00 Enter the competition below:
