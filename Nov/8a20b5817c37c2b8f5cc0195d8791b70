Tehran - Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the terrorist attack in Iraq on Thursday that claimed the lives of 80 pilgrims, among them 24 Iranians. It is an indication of frustration, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by official IRNA news agency. The terrorists launched such attacks to compensate for the repeated defeats they have suffered recently, Qasemi said. Such brutal and inhuman acts are not going to affect the determination of the Iraqi people and its government; neither could they disrupt the Islamic republic's joint fight with Iraq against terrorism, he said. Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Islamic republic's embassy in Baghdad are seriously pursuing the case, he added. Officials here confirmed the death of 24 Iranian pilgrims in the suicide tanker truck bomb attack at a fuel station in Babil province in south of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Thursday, state IRIB TV reported. Up to 80 people were killed and some 31 others wounded in the suicide attack on Shi a Muslim pilgrims on Thursday afternoon, Iraqi security official said. ANA-Xinhua
