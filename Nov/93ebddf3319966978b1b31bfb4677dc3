Johannesburg - Officials in the Gauteng provincial government tasked with issuing taxi permits and licences must be subjected to lifestyle audits if the violence in the country&apos;s biggest public transport industry is to be stopped.This is among the recommendations made in a damning report by the provincial standing committee on roads and transport, which was adopted by the provincial legislature on Tuesday.Some of the officials, including police officers, have been accused of owning taxis and selectively issuing taxi permits by giving the papers to certain individuals while ignoring others. In many cases this has led to deadly taxi wars.The ad hoc committee, headed by Jacob Khawe, began its hearings in March last year and concluded them in September this year.The report found, among others:The police weren&apos;t constantly monitoring taxi ranks, which resulted in their actions being more reactive than proactive.There was a lack of implementation of rules and regulations concerning enforcement agencies under investigation for owning taxis.There were about 60 cases under investigation involving SAPS members and traffic officials/officers suspected of being taxi owners, with only one provincial traffic official suspended. He said the taxi was bought for his mother.Some officers were taxi owners, and evidence pointed to their having other operators&#x2019; vehicles confiscated illegally in order to have their vehicles maximise profits.There was evidence that not all roadblocks targeting the taxi industry were being convened in conjunction with the SAPS.Hitmen were used to take out opponents in the industry.There were no regular route audits, which fanned the violence.In one of the hearings, departmental officials confessed that a taxi permit was stolen from them and ended up in the hands of taxi owners who, according to evidence heard, would set up illegal manufacturing factories in Gauteng and reproduce the taxi permit. They would sell those to clients from various parts of the country, particularly KwaZulu-Natal.The report fell short of exposing the corrupt government officials, police and taxi associations.Khawe said on Tuesday that some of the people privy to the corruption withheld information because they were being threatened and intimated.Among the major recommendations the committee made was to encourage the legislature to consider the involvement of provincial traffic police and officials from the departments of Community Safety and of Roads and Transport. This would ensure all transport-related functions were co-ordinated under a single entity.&#x201C;If all role players could implement the recommendations, the taxi industry would be reliable, safe, affordable and professionalised,&#x201D; Khawe said.He listed some factors that hampered the committee&apos;s investigation.&#x201C;There was a lack of presentable evidence on corruption allegations and murders, plus the unwillingness of witnesses to testify, which negated the successful prosecution of perpetrators.&#x201C;There was a clear lack of co-operation and co-ordination between the criminal justice system and the taxi industry,&#x201D; Khawe said.The report also recommended that the South African Local Government Association play a greater role in ensuring that municipalities process taxi permit applications and licences promptly, in accordance with the law.&#x201C;It was submitted that national systems are too old and cannot handle the pressure of new applications. Submissions were also made that the systems are always off-line.&#x201C;The failure of the one-year written permit system ended up adding to the backlog,&#x201D; Khawe said.The committee further recommended that the national Department of Roads and Transport conduct an independent audit of routes and determine who should use them. The process should be modelled on the system being implemented in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.&#x201C;The department should consider establishing an independent dispute resolution committee to resolve conflicts pertaining to taxi operations, routes and operating licences.&#x201C;(It) should consider undertaking lifestyle audits on all officials within the department who are involved in the process of issuing operating licence audits as part of preventing potential fraudulent activities,&#x201D; the report stated.South African National Taxi Association Gauteng secretary Ralph Jones said they would comment after receiving a copy of the report.
