London - A boarding school teacher had an &#x2018;all-night sex fest&#x2019; with a girl pupil after watching porn with her at his home, a court heard on Tuesday.Music teacher Simon Ball, 42, is also said to have persuaded the girl to take part in a threesome with another teenage girl from the school.When she appeared upset, he allegedly told her: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t get jealous - come and join in.&#x2019;The claims were made on the second day of a trial where Ball is accused of seducing or molesting four pupils aged between 13 and 16 at &#xA3;31,800-a-year (about R560 000) Giggleswick School in Settle, North Yorkshire.He has admitted five offences against one of the girls, with the prosecution telling the jury: &#x2018;Those convictions show he has a clear sexual interest in schoolgirls.&#x2019;A police interview was played at Peterborough Crown Court on Tuesday, where one of the alleged victims described watching adult videos with the married teacher during their four-month relationship.&#x2018;I remember him putting pornography on while we were in the living room and it was just like... it was just a sex fest. It was sex all night,&#x2019; she told officers.&#x2018;There was a time - I think it was that night... he asked me to have sex on his wife&#x2019;s wedding dress and we did. He laid it on the floor and we had sex on top of it and he put it back in the cupboard.&#x2019;The former pupil, now in her 20s, said she had developed a hatred for Ball&#x2019;s now ex-wife, Hannah Atherton, 40, based on what the defendant had told her. She said: &#x2018;I just remember she was there sometimes, around the school, and I absolutely hated her and he just made me have this feeling about her that she was a complete and utter cow.&#x2018;And I remember when he suggested doing that on her wedding dress, it was like &#x201C;She&#x2019;s a bitch&#x201D; and &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s do it&#x201D;.&#x2019;The woman spoke of another occasion when she and another alleged victim went to Ball&#x2019;s house and they ended up having sex with him at the same time. &#x2018;When we were there he invited me up to his bedroom and he asked [the other girl] to come too,&#x2019; she said.&#x2018;I remember feeling really jealous because I didn&#x2019;t realise that is why he got her to come around as well. And when he saw me getting jealous he said, you know, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t get jealous - come and join in&#x201D;.&#x2019; Pupil claims teacher Simon Ball romped with her all night as they watched porn | Daily Star: https://t.co/yijH9b47w2 &#x2014; pops (@pops131) November 16, 2016 Pupil claims teacher Simon Ball romped with her all night as they watched porn | Daily Star: https://t.co/yijH9b47w2 Ball, of Greenwich, South-East London, began his teaching career at the independent co-educational school in 1999 after he left university.
