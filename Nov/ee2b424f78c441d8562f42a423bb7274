Cape Town - Metrorail has warned that it will be clamping down on aberrant behaviour, criminals and ticket defaulters with the launch of its festive season safety campaign, Operation Spider .Western Cape regional manager, Richard Walker, said webs of enforcements would clamp down at stations at any given time to net criminal elements . Special multi-disciplinary teams would work to reduce fare evasion, ticket fraud and crime by focusing on access control and security resources at junction stations. Spider has a dual strategy; ensuring legal compliance among commuters and driving criminals out of the system. Our action teams will be supported by mobile units on motor bikes which can give chase. Our teams will check for fraudulent tickets, issue fines for Act 89 misdemeanours and conduct weapon and drug searches. This approach has proven to be very effective during its recent test phase. This more productive use of resources allowed us to check tickets at least once during a trip and resulted in a satisfactory spike in arrests, said Walker.Some of the stations that will experience clampdown operations during peak hours include Mutual, Woltemade, Koeberg, Esplanade, Ysterplaat, Maitland, Pinelands, Bonteheuwel and Cape Town. Walker warned that loyal paying customers should not be inconvenienced by fare evaders hogging space without valid tickets. Contrary to people s beliefs, members of the South African Police Service and armed forces were not entitled to free train rides. Anyone on board a train without a valid ticket is illegal and will face fines, or arrest and prosecution risking a criminal record if found guilty, said Walker.Cape Argus
