Cape Town - No lectures? No problem. For a select few, that means basking in the sunshine, lounging on the beach and finishing the university curriculum.Lectures on the beach have become a possibility for those engaging in &#x201C;blended learning&#x201D;, an education programme that involves combining the internet and digital media with conventional classroom methods which has been adopted by UCT after the #FeesMustFall student protests.&#x201C;My blended learning experience entailed a lot of procrastination, movies and going to the beach,&#x201D;said student Keanu Domingo.A mild reminder that it&#x2019;s actually exams has only just begun to sink in: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s started to hit me so I&#x2019;ve been trying to get a lot of work done,&#x201D;he said.Since the suspension of lectures, blended learning has been used to continue the academic year and provide stability during a period of uncertainty regarding the completion of the year.Domingo decided to make the most of the situation:&#x201C;Most of the time I studied in super fun places. I know a lot of other people are stressed, but I went home to J-bay, sat on the beach or in the garden and studied with my dogs and some snacks at hand. I took it quite relaxed and just tried to make the best of a bad situation.&#x201C;If I wasn&#x2019;t able to choose my own study space, I don&#x2019;t know how I would have got through it.&#x201D;Lecture videos and readings were made available online.&#x201C;Resources were mostly online as that&#x2019;s where all the work that we couldn&#x2019;t get through was available.&#x201C;The positives were that I could choose my work environment. I chose the beach.&#x201C;I have always been better at learning on my own, so for me, having the opportunity to lie outside with my books in an environment that wasn&#x2019;t stressful and one I wanted to be in made me more productive. Another plus was that I could eat as much as I wanted while working, which is a bit harder to do when you&#x2019;re sitting in a tutorial or lecture theatre.&#x201C;On a more serious note, blended learning has enabled me to complete the academic year and exams are scheduled to take place, for which I am grateful,&#x201D;he said.And the negatives? &#x201C;It&#x2019;s difficult to write study notes and snack at the same time, and it&#x2019;s weird staring at a lecturer onscreen for hours on end, it gets really boring,&#x201D;he joked.One a more serious note: &#x201C;The reality of this kind of learning is the stature of my degree might be affected because I am missing out on physical classes from recognised lecturers and academics.&#x201C;I think the issue will have a lot of detrimental implications, students pay such high fees and now they will be missing out on having the accreditation that a UCT degree has previously held. Without the additional practical resources, such as hot-seats and tuts, self-studying has become a bigger challenge for many students,&#x201D;said Domingo.Apart from studying on the beach, Domingo said, &#x201C;Overall, the reality is that the negatives far outweigh the positives and I much prefer the interaction and structure that comes with attending on campus lectures.&#x201D; Independent on Saturday IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
