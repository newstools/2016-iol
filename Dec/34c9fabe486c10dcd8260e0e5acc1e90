The SANDF soldiers wounded in the recent attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are recovering in hospital. An SANDF spokesman, Brigadier-General Xolani Mabanga, said Rifleman Sidumo Simon Mbhamali, 25, was in a critical condition at a hospital in Kinshasha. Mbhamali, of Jozini in KwaZulu-Natal, was shot in the neck. He belonged to the 4th South African Infantry Battalion. Corporal Bonginkosi David Phakathi, 42, of Mpumalanga Signal Unit, is in a hospital in Goma. He was wounded in his hand. The SANDF are part of the Force Intervention Brigade of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Congo, with the responsibility of ensuring peace and stability in the eastern part of the DRC. Members of the Mayi Mayi and Allied Democratic Forces groups attacked the SANDF position near Butembu last week. Four Mayi Mayi rebels were killed and two captured. Moalosi Albert Mokhothu, a rifleman with the 1 Parachute Battalion in Bloemfontein, was killed. The SANDF will have a ceremonial parade at Air Force Base Waterkloof today to receive Mokhothu s body. In addition, we will inscribe his name on the wall of remembrance,&quot; said Mabanga. &quot;He will be acknowledged as a hero who paid the ultimate price while contributing towards peace, stability and prosperity in the continent, he said. There were some emotional posts on Facebook. Silvia Mothopi, a medical assistant at the South African Military Health Service, described Mokhothu as a brother, friend and comrade-in-arms. It is always sad in the armed forces community to lose one of our own, said South African Legion spokesman Peter Dickens. President Jacob Zuma saluted Mokhothu for his courage and his contribution, saying it would never be forgotten.Daily News
