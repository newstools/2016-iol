Cape Town - It's tough for an ex-convict to find work, but one organisation is equipping this group of vulnerable people with the skills to start their own businesses.Siyakhana runs entrepreneurship training for recently-released prisoners wanting to turn their lives, and fortunes, around. Four former prisoners graduated at a ceremony in Woodstock at the weekend. Entrepreneur, facilitator and organiser Siphesihle Nopotwa said they enrol young people who come out of prison in a six-month programme. We give them knowledge on how to start their own businesses. After prison it's hard to get a job because of the stigma. So we equip them to start businesses to better their lives in terms of making their own money. We have two programmes - art therapy inside prison and entrepreneurship outside prison. The Siyakhana programme has 10 students but attendance has been always an issue because some of our target types have not yet changed (their ways). Graduate Sakhiwo Ndawose, 25, from Philippi spent six months behind bars. To be a graduate today is a great honour to myself and my family. The programme has helped me a lot because now I know where to start to pursue my dreams. I ve seen myself as a businessman for many years, but now I m on the right path to make my dreams come true. In 2017 I will start my own coffee shop. Graduate Dumisa Ngqoyiyana, 26, from Langa, said: I was in prison for five years, but I finished my matric inside. Now I want to start an orphanage because I love children. Phumlani Mango, 22, from Samora Machel, who was in prison for one month, said in two years' time he sees himself owning a laundry. Simnikiwe Sanana, 21, from Khayelitsha, said. &quot;In three years' time I see myself owning an internet cafe. Cape Times
