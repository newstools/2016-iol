Johannesburg - AngloGold Ashanti on Thursday reported an improved production outlook at its Tropicana Gold Mine in Australia based on higher mining and processing rates along with a 45 percent increase in the mine's ore reserve estimate. AngloGold said its strategy to address the planned decline in production following the end of grade streaming last year had been successful. The ore reserve estimate for Tropicana has increased by 1.18 million ounces of contained gold. The throughput capacity of the processing plant rose from 5.8 million tonnes per annum to 7.5 million tonnes per annum and the introduction of a 600 tonne shovel accelerated mining rates. As a result, AngoGold said gold production was expected to increase to an annualised rate of between 450 000 to 490 000 ounce per annum from the second half of calendar 2017, with further increases anticipated but depending on the outcome of the Long Island Study.Read also: AngloGold to be more cautious on forecasts The Long Island Study is based on strip mining of the depth extensions of the Tropicana mineralised system and using the completed Tropicana pit as an initial void into which waste will be backfilled.Michael Erickson, AngloGold Ashanti's senior vice president Australia, said they were optimistic of the outlook because of innovative drilling at the mine.&quot;We've adopted an innovative, holistic approach that demonstrates the quality of this asset and the enhanced returns it will deliver to stakeholders,&quot; Erickson said. &quot;The Tropicana mineralised system remains open along strike and at depth and the recent exciting drilling results make us optimistic that we can further improve the outlook.&quot; Tropicana is a joint venture between AngloGold Ashanti Australia, which owns 70 percent and manages the mine, and Independence Group.AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
