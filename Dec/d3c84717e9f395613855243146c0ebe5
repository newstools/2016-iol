Cape Town - About 600 homeless people and children from disadvantaged areas across Cape Town were served a pre-Christmas lunch on Sunday.Held in Church Street in the city centre and arranged by Ladles of Love, the lunch was to help restore the dignity of the homeless and poor, the organisation s founder, Danny Diliberto said. The organisation is all about giving back to the communities and restoring dignity of the individuals, so that they can feel special for a day and not be seen as homeless, said Diliberto.Ezra Mgwigwi, 55, of Khayelitsha said he felt good about the lunch as he came along with his five children. It's my second time to come to the lunch. Moira Mally, 51, of Mitchells Plain said: I ve been homeless for six years now and the Christmas lunch excites me every year because it's not something we get everyday. These people are really doing a good job. They are helping so many lives. Leean Adams, 24, of Valhalla Park, a regular at the Christmas lunch, said she heard about it from her late mother who had been homeless for many years.Cape Times
