Istanbul - Turkey detained 1 682 people in the past week as part of raids against alleged Kurdish militants,&nbsp;Islamic State and followers of US-based preacher Fethullah&nbsp;Gulen, according to data from the Interior Ministry released Monday.This raises to nearly 2 700 the number of people detained in the past two weeks as part of what the government sees as a war on terrorism.Of those taken into custody in the last week, 516 were formally arrested, including 426 alleged followers of Gulen, 12 accused members of Islamic State and 78 suspected of links to Kurdish militants. Four Kurdish fighters were captured, the government said.Last week, the authorities said they detained 924 people suspected of links to the Kurdistan&nbsp;Workers'&nbsp;Party&nbsp;(PKK) and detained 88 alleged members of Islamic State.Gulen, a Turkish-born preacher, is accused of plotting the July coup attempt, charges he denies.Meanwhile, the deputy co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), Aysel Tugluk, was detained by Turkish anti-terrorism police at her home in the capital&nbsp;Ankara, following a string of arrests of her fellow party members.The HDP called her detention &quot;illegal.&quot; The state-run&nbsp;Anadolu news agency said she was under investigation for terrorism related charges.Tugluk acts as a lawyer for arrested HDP&nbsp;leaders. The authorities are currently holding in prison 12 HDP members of parliament, including the group's co-chairs. Parliament lifted the immunities of nearly all of the party's 59 deputies.In the south-east, 54 municipalities have been formally taken over by the central government and their elected mayors - all affiliated with the HDP - deposed. There is no sign there will be fresh elections.Thousands of party members have been arrested in the past year, according to the HDP, a leftist party which aims to represent the country's large Kurdish minority, a group which often complains of systematic discrimination by the state.The government has accused the HDP of links to terrorism, charges the party staunchly denies. It often condemns bombings by Kurdish militant groups and is urging the government to restart peace talks with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers'&nbsp;Party&nbsp;(PKK), an armed group.Also, more than 120 journalists remain in jail, and dozens of outlets have been shut down in recent months. Among those in jail are 10 members of Cumhuriyet, a left-leaning opposition newspaper that has won a number of awards, including in&nbsp;Europe.Cumhuriyet reported that a man who worked at a refreshment stand at the daily was arrested for insulting President Recep&nbsp;Tayyip&nbsp;Erdogan. Earlier this year, the government said nearly 2 000 people were arrested in Turkey for insulting the leader.Turkish authorities have opened investigations into 3 710 people over social media posts in the past six months, while 1,656 suspects are under arrest. Some are accused of insults while others are arrested for allegedly supporting terrorism.ANA-dpa
