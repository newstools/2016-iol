Cape Town Noting that sub-Saharan Africa's GDP growth rate for 2016 would be even lower than that of the beleaguered Eurozone, the Economist says it sees reason to hope that 2017 will be better, thanks, at least in part, to the continent s smaller stars.&nbsp; Writing in an editorial on Thursday, Simon Baptist, the respected publication s chief economist, said the improved expectations were partly due to increases in many commodity prices and pointed to gains in some of the region's smaller economies.&nbsp; While Nigeria and South Africa by far the two biggest economies will continue to keep the average GDP growth down to a moderate 2.6 percent, there are a number of stars, Baptist said.&nbsp; He mentioned Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda as economies among the Economist s predictions for the world s 20 fastest growing economies in 2017.&nbsp; Baptist also pointed to Ghana, which is expected to grow by seven percent in 2017 due to rising oil and gas production and a boost to the industrial sector from increasing electricity generation.&nbsp; He also noted that Ghana, a bright spot for democracy in 2016 , had undergone another smooth election and a transfer of power from government to opposition.&nbsp; ANA
