Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the kidnap victim was found in Thornton on Wednesday night. Naushad Deshmukh Kahn had been abducted in early November from outside his clothing store, Kahns, in Rylands Estate, Athlone, as he was locking up for the night. He was allegedly attacked by six armed men who fled with him and an undisclosed amount of cash. The men left his female colleague behind unharmed. He reportedly called home a few days later, telling his family that his kidnappers demanded £20 million (R338 million) for his safe return. Van Wyk said on Thursday that the father of three had received medical attention, but would not disclose any further information. "The missing owner of Khans in Rylands Estate, Athlone has been found in Thornton last night and he is currently receiving medical attention. “The circumstances surrounding his disappearance are under police investigation and the finer aspects thereof will not be disclosed,” he said. Van Wyk urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
