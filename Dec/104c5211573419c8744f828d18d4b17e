Istanbul - A seven-year-old Syrian girl
who drew global attention with her Twitter updates from besieged
Aleppo met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at his palace in
Ankara on Wednesday. Photographs released on Erdogan's official Twitter account
showed the president hugging Bana Alabed as she sat on his lap. Bana and her mother Fatemah were evacuated safely along with
25 000 other people from the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo
this week. Turkey has supported rebels fighting Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad. "I was pleased to host @AlabedBana and her family at the
Presidential Complex today. Turkey will always stand with the
people of Syria," Erdogan said on his official Twitter account. Helped by her mother, who manages the @AlabedBana account,
Bana Alabed has uploaded pictures and videos of life during the
nearly six-year-old Syrian war, gaining around 352 000 followers
on the micro-blogging site since September.    Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said when Bana and
her mother were evacuated from Aleppo that she would be brought
to Turkey with her family. The eventual departure of thousands left in Aleppo's
insurgent zone will hand full control of the city to Assad, the
biggest prize of the nearly six-year-old civil war. Reuters
