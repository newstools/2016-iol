Giyani Limpopo police, assisted by community members, have launched a massive search for the victim of an armed robbery who was allegedly pushed into a flooded river by two unknown robbers after he and his friend were robbed of R310. &quot;The search comprises the search and rescue unit and divers from Thohoyandou, the K9 [unit], the local police, and community members,&quot; Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said on Saturday. The alleged robbery took place at Maswanganyi villiage when Desmond Fantini, 28, and his friend Tebogo Ngonyama, 19, were on the way home to Mapuve. Two suspects confronted them and demanded money at gunpoint, he said. &quot;According to information, the two victims were then escorted at gunpoint towards the flooding Ritavi River and forced to cross. The first victim, Desmond, managed to swim across whereas Tebogo allegedly failed and is presumed drowned. The police also launched a manhunt for the two suspects.&quot; &quot;We are appealing to our communities in the area to refrain from taking the law into their own hands but continue to work with us to find the missing victim and to also assist in tracking down these merciless criminals,&quot; Mojapelo said.
