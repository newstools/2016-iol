Damascus - Fighting, shelling and airstrikes resumed Wednesday in Aleppo,&nbsp;dashing hopes that an agreed evacuation of rebel fighters and civilians would start in the early hours of the morning.A fleet of government busses that were awaiting the evacuees at a crossing point in Aleppo left the scene empty after shelling resumed, a pro-Syrian government source said.Government and opposition sources traded blame for the failure of the evacuation deal, which had been brokered the day before by Syrian government ally Russia and rebel backer Turkey.Civilians in the shrinking pocket of rebel-held territory, having braced themselves for leaving their homes, found themselves once more fearing imminent death with government forces closing in amid heavy shelling.&quot;We want to leave... we don't want more massacres, let us leave, what is happening,&quot; one activist wrote on a messaging group set up to communicate with journalists.UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he was &quot;appalled&quot; the deal had collapsed, adding that the government's heavy shelling of &quot;an area packed with civilians is almost certainly a violation of international law and most likely constitutes war crimes.&quot;&quot;The way this deal was dangled in front of this battered and beleaguered population - causing them to hope they might indeed live to see another day - and then snatched away just half a day later is also outrageously cruel,&quot; Zeid said.Activists and medical workers say they fear for their lives if captured by Syrian government forces and their allies, including foreign Shiite militias.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitor, said that regime forces resumed shelling, airstrikes and a ground advance on the small area still held by rebels, hours after the evacuation had been due to start, causing unspecified casualties.Rebels then shelled regime-held areas in the western sector of Aleppo, killing at least eight civilians,&nbsp;the Observatory added.&nbsp;The government source, who declined to be quoted by name, said the &quot;delay&quot; in the evacuation was due to disagreements among rebel leaders. Russian state news agency TASS quoted Russian military personnel in Syria as saying that fighting had resumed when rebels opened fire on the waiting busses. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his US counterpart John Kerry that the Syrian military &quot;has long been&quot; ready to allow rebels to leave eastern Aleppo. However, fighters linked to the al-Qaeda jihadist network were sabotaging humanitarian efforts in the city and not ceasing fire, Lavrov said in the conversation, initiated by the US, according to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said that Erdogan had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the two reaffirmed their commitment to start the evacuation of civilians and the opposition through safe corridors as soon as possible.The Observatory and rebel sources blamed the failure of the evacuation on disagreements on the government side. Rebel sources cited new demands for the lifting of a rebel siege on the government-held Shiite villages of Foua and Kefraya in north-western Syria.The Observatory said that the two villages came under shelling on Wednesday, inflicting casualties among the residents without specifying numbers.Some activists posted that the shelling on Foua and Kefraya came to avenge the renewed bombardement on eastern Aleppo.Feras Shehabi, a Syrian parliamentarian, meanwhile called&nbsp;for execution of all &quot;militants&quot; left in eastern Aleppo.&quot;This is not strange that insurgents&nbsp;prevented civilians from leaving. They [rebels] are the ones who breached the agreement. We&nbsp;hope they will finally be liquidated,&quot; he told dpa.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said that the military should focus on the battle for Aleppo before trying to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra, which Islamic State jihadists captured from his forces on Sunday.&quot;We liberated Palmyra before, we will liberate it once again. This is war, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,&quot; al-Assad said in comments carried by Russian state news agency TASS on Wednesday.&quot;But we must keep in mind that the focus should be on Aleppo at the moment.&quot;He said his military will not cease its advance after taking Aleppo and will drive on to capture more territory from militant groups. &quot;There will be an end to military actions only in those regions where terrorists say they are ready to give up and withdraw,&quot; al-Assad said.ANA-dpa
