Following the long awaited PS4 PRO, which finally launched in South Africa on the 7th of December, Sony has formed a divide with this mid-generation addition to the console evolution. What makes the PS4 PRO an enhanced version of the slimmer PS4, which was released not long before the PS4 Pro? The internal capacity of the Pro's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is more superior to the slimmer model – "GPU has jumped from 1.84 TFLOP in the launch PS4 to 4.2 TFLOP in the Pro," according to Techradar. If you don't have a 4K television it was said that there are some improvements on 1080p TV, although from what I've read they are subtle framerate and resolution improvements. This video displays the jump to 4k that the PS4 Pro is pushing the visual boundaries for supreme graphical performance. Is this what everyone can attain or even really desires? IOL Mojo
