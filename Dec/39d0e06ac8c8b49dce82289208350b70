Rustenburg Two brothers, arrested for alleged raping three women from Botswana, are expected to appear in the Rustenburg Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, North West police said. Lieutenant Colonel Pelonomi Makau said the brothers aged 28 and 32 were arrested on Sunday, after they were linked to a case of rape and robbery committed in November in Marikana.&quot;It is alleged that in November 2016, three women who are Botswana nationals were hitchhiking to Johannesburg when the suspects ... offered them a lift,&quot; said Makau. The suspects were thought to be brothers. &quot;Allegedly, while on the way between Marikana and Rustenburg, the suspects drove into the bushes where they threatened the victims with a firearm before they took turns to rape them.&quot; The two allegedly robbed the women of their cellphones, clothes and an undisclosed amount of cash before they fled the scene. &quot;The victims managed to go to Marikana Police Station, where they reported the incident. A thorough investigation led to the arrest of the suspects in Majakaneng village, where the victims cellphones and clothes were found,&quot; said Makau. The pair will appear before the court Tuesday.ANA
