Zastron The police in Zastron in the Free State are looking for the families of 16 people, including children, who died in a head-on collision between a minibus taxi and a bakkie outside Zastron on Friday. &quot;Due to the fact that the deceased burnt beyond recognition during the accident it has become impossible to identify them,&quot; Colonel Thandi Mbambo said. &quot;A call is therefore made to people who were expecting loved ones from Johannesburg to Sterkspruit on the 16 December 2016 and they didn t arrive, to contact Zastron Detective Captain Charles Brown at 082-467-6432 or go to Sterkspruit police station on Tuesday.&quot; Forensic experts from Pretoria had been mobilised to assist and they needed DNA samples from the next-of-kin for possible comparison with the dead so as to be able to identify them. They would be at Sterkspruit police station from Tuesday morning, Mbambo said. African News Agency
