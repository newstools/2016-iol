Johannesburg - South African police on Wednesday said nine persons had been arrested during protests at the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&nbsp; On Tuesday about 250 DRC nationals protested outside their country's embassy in Francis Baard Street, Pretoria, where they demanded that their President Joseph Kabila step down.&nbsp; Kabila's term ended on Monday, but he has remained in power pending elections. In a statement on Wednesday national spokesperson for the South African Police Service, Brigadier Sally de Beer, said two bus loads of protesters arrived at the embassy.&nbsp; She said an unauthorised protest took place on Tuesday which turned violent when stones were thrown at the embassy building and at members of the SAPS.&nbsp; &quot;A member of the Diplomatic Policing Unit was disarmed by protesters during this incident and his firearm was stolen. Windows and the front gate of the embassy were damaged as the protesters attempted to gain entry to the embassy,&quot; said De Beer. &quot; SAPS members, including members of the Public Order Police, dispersed the crowd and nine persons were arrested on various charges including malicious damage to property and public violence.&quot;&nbsp; Those arrested were expected to appear in court soon.&nbsp; Owing to the protests the DRC embassy has shutdown its operations and there was no indication when it would re-open.&nbsp; African News Agency
