The hotel offers 13 double rooms with en-suite bathrooms, free high speed Wi-Fi and a mini bar.  Together with the launch of the boutique hotel, a trendy collection of hospitality and leisure spaces called ‘The Grey’, will be launched at the same time. The trend-epicentre destination hotel is home to Skybar, SHIO restaurant, The Piano Bar and KOS kiosk, together forming ‘The Grey Experience’, each with a unique purpose for tourists and local hangout spots. The Grey Boutique Hotel incorporates décor elements of Moroccan influences with splashes of colour in the courtyards and imported décor materials.  Co-Owner and Managing Director of The Grey Boutique Hotel, Lisa Calligaro, embarked on the ‘The Grey’ project in June 2016, creating an urban destination point in Cape Town for those wanting to experience De Waterkant.
