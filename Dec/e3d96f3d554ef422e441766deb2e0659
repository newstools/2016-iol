"Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael Jim Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you," McDonald's tweeted. This is Michael "Jim" Delligatti - the inventor of the Big Mac who died this week aged 98. He came up with the idea in 1967 along with its famous "secret sauce". Whilst not everyone maybe a McD fan, we reckon "Jim" is a total legend! üçîüçü RIP. #MichaelDelligatti #BigMac #mcdonalds A photo posted by TeleCare24 (@telecare24) on Nov 30, 2016 at 11:02pm PST Delligatti, who died Monday night at his home outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, cooked up the idea of the Big Mac while operating his own McDonald's franchise in the Pittsburgh area in 1965, the Wall Street Journal reports.

"I never would have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana," Delligatti once said. DPA
