 But when visitors choose to take a piece of the Holy Land back home with them, they better check the labels. Many souvenirs including the West Bank town's trademark rosemary beads are imported from abroad, mainly China. A small number of souvenir shops are now trying to fight the trend, stocking their shelves almost exclusively with locally made products. Shopkeepers say that while their wares may be more expensive, the quality is much better and they give an important boost to the struggling economy.

Many will visit Bethlehem, where globalization has left its imprint like everywhere else. Foreign-made crafts, especially Chinese ones, have come to represent a big part of the market here, including Christmas souvenirs. While there are no official statistics, local officials and businessmen estimate that nearly half of the products, perhaps more, are imported.

Bethlehem is in the West Bank, occupied territory the Palestinians hope will be part of their future state. Tourism remains strong, but the rest of the economy has long languished, in part because of Israeli restrictions. Tourists must pass through a checkpoint in Israel's separation barrier to reach the town.

The Visit Palestine Center, which started as an online store and travel guide five years ago, works with nearly 100 workshops and home-based artisans throughout the Palestinian territories and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan.

"Maintaining consistency and quality, the right lead time, figuring how much production capacity the producers can give," are some of them, explained Khoury. Then there's the issue of price.

Canawati said he wants to give his customers options, and he is clear about the differences.

Muhammad Yusuf, a wood craftsman with The Olive Wood Factory, scoffs at the imports. "It's not good, this is better," he said with a smile as he worked on a figure of the Virgin Mary. AP
