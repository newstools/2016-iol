Johannesburg - The Labour Court has confirmed Eskom s 2013/14 final offer of a salary increase for staff of 5.6 percent by upholding the arbitrator s award to Eskom and dismissing the unions application for review.&nbsp; During the negotiations, Eskom made its final offer across the board and a range of related increases and benefits to employees in the bargaining unit for the financial years 2013 and 2014, the parastatal said in a statement on Saturday.&nbsp; A resolution could not be reached as the unions stuck to their average demands the National Union of Mineworker (39 percent), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (44.3 percent), and Solidarity (20.1 percent).&nbsp; Consequently, a deadlock ensued and the matter was referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) for interest arbitration.&nbsp; The arbitrator in turn ruled that Eskom's offer was fair and reasonable. He made specific mention of the fact that Eskom was funded through regulated revenue, Eskom said.&nbsp; He took into consideration the fact that acceding to the unions demands would have adversely affected Eskom's revenue stream and potential risk exposure.&nbsp; Recognising the fact that the multi-year price determination three (MYPD3) tariff had resulted in a revenue reduction of R225 billion for Eskom over the five-year control period through a combination of costs and disallowances for operating and capital expenditure, as well as the granting of lower return on assets, he accepted that Eskom had to control its costs responsibly when faced with certain funding deficits. Discontented with the arbitrator s award, the unions took it on review to the Labour Court shortly thereafter.&nbsp; This week, the Labour Court upheld the arbitrator s award in favour of Eskom, and dismissed the unions application for review. Had Eskom acceded to these demands, it would have been required to acquire and pay an additional total cost of employment increase of R5.031 billion, R5.7 billion, and R2.586 billion respectively.&nbsp; As Eskom was a regulated entity, any increase in manpower costs could affect its tariff calculation.&nbsp; Going forward Eskom and its recognised trade unions were required to ensure that the offers they put forward were reasonable and fair for the benefit of employees and the country as a whole, Eskom said.&nbsp; African News Agency
