2016 was a momentous year which witnessed the realignment of global politics, writes Shannon Ebrahim. It was the US election campaign which dominated the headlines this year, ending in the victory of Donald Trump a development with cataclysmic ramifications for the US and the world.&nbsp; While the nature of US domestic politics is unlikely to be the same again, Trump s approach to international relations and his perspective towards certain world leaders will alter US strategy.&nbsp; It is the first time since World War II that a US president-elect has promised to reverse the internationalism of its past presidents.&nbsp; Trump s juggernaut to the White House was characterised by a campaign that appealed to the struggling middle class, which gravitated towards a leader who promised to protect jobs and local manufacturing.&nbsp; Trump s message that he would rewrite the text of international trade deals in the interests of US workers struck a chord with voters.&nbsp; The most significant seachange in America s international relations is likely to be its relations with Russia that will see a new collaboration on international affairs and global conflicts.&nbsp; This has the potential to unleash positive results, depending on whether policies are guided by the principles of human security, but could also see the world descend into further chaos if military solutions are prioritised over political ones.&nbsp; If the views of Trump s advisers on the Middle East are translated into policy, we could see the envisaged two-state solution in Israel/Palestine fall by the wayside.With the war in Syria still raging, refugees flooding into Europe, conflict escalating in Turkey, Yemen and South Sudan, and continual nuclear tests by North Korea, there is likely to be no honeymoon period for Trump in international relations.&nbsp; The decimation of Syria&nbsp; A member of forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad stands with a civilian on the rubble of the Carlton Hotel, in the government controlled area of Aleppo. Picture: Reuters The fifth year of civil war in Syria escalated to unprecedented levels of misery and destruction. Many of Syria s towns lie in ruins, and over a million Syrian citizens are living under siege many unable to access food and medical supplies. In violation of all the international rules of war, the tactics of submit or starve became the order of the day, and chemical weapons were dropped on a number of Syrian towns.&nbsp; Syrian refugees that flooded to the Turkish coastal city of Gazientep to escape bombardment and starvation spoke to journalists this year about their loss of hope in seeing an imminent end to the war, and of the immense challenges that lie ahead in eventually rebuilding the country.&nbsp; Most youngsters evaded the tented refugee camps in Turkey and made their way to other European countries like Germany.&nbsp; The human train of misery that poured out of Syria this year turned the Mediterranean into a virtual graveyard.&nbsp; The International Organisation for Migration estimates that by the beginning of this month 4 699 migrants and refugees lost their lives in the Mediterranean, with over 350 573 entering Europe through Italy and Greece.&nbsp; While many came from Syria, among the boatloads that perished were also refugees and economic migrants from Iraq, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea.&nbsp; The rise of the right in Europe&nbsp; The influx of refugees from poor and often Muslim countries has seen the rise of xenophobia and right-wing extremism across Europe.&nbsp; The rise in popularity of right-wing political figures such as Marine le Pen has seen her ahead in the polls in France, and may see her ousting incumbent President Francois Hollande in next year s presidential elections.&nbsp; Austria s right-wing politician Norbert Hofer clinched 35 percent of the vote this year, and had brandished a gun on the campaign trail as he fired up anti-immigrant sentiment Hungary s Viktor Oban and Slovakia s Robert Fico have also remained popular for defending Christian culture against Muslims and foreigners.&nbsp; The right-wing politician Geert Wilders in the Netherlands has also been leading in the polls, and has promised a referendum on leaving the EU.&nbsp; The rise of far right politics in Europe suggests that the European continent is moving away from inclusive pluralistic societies, which may become increasingly Islamophobic. This will fuel the sentiments that drive ideological adherents to the Islamic State, and could lead to increasingly lone wolf and co-ordinated IS attacks across Europe.&nbsp; The Brexit victory&nbsp; The decision by a majority of UK voters to leave the EU was a shock to Europe and the rest of the world, and even to some of the Brexiteers.&nbsp; The frustration of ordinary Britons had been largely underestimated, and has ushered in a new era of isolationist policies whereby Britain will focus internally on what is best for Britain and not on what is best for Europe as a region.&nbsp; The success of the Brexiteers can be understood against the backdrop of the rise of right-wing politics in Europe more generally.&nbsp; The struggling middle class in Britain as well as elsewhere in Europe is largely the result of the failure of nation states to manage the negative effects of globalisation.&nbsp; In the UK there are deeply entrenched geographic inequalities that have been made worse by the loss of jobs to lower wage destinations. The favourable response to the Brexit campaign can be seen as a backlash against the existing political establishment and immigration.&nbsp; Immigrants have largely been blamed for seizing jobs, driving down wages, and overburdening the public service.&nbsp; Turkey s slide towards authoritarianism&nbsp; The attempted coup on July 15 in Turkey set off a chain reaction that has culminated in the decimation of the influential Gulen movement in the country, which was blamed for the attempted coup.&nbsp; The attempted coup was carried out by a faction within the Turkish armed forces.&nbsp; The Turkish government s subsequent witch-hunt against all members of the Gulen movement and their purging from all arms of government and positions of authority, quickly became a slippery slope towards acting against a broad spectrum of domestic political opposition. The goverment has purged more than 110 000 officials, including police officers, judges, prosecutors, and educationists. A total of 150 media outlets have been closed down and more than 130 editors are being detained.&nbsp; According to international human rights organisations, torture has also become rampant.&nbsp; Turkey s undemocratic practices have led to extensive criticism by the EU, compelling Turkey to seek out new allies in the global arena, particularly Russia and China. This represents a realignment of global politics of particular significance given Turkey s geostrategic importance in the AsiaMiddle East region. It may also have implications for the war in Syria, given that Turkey s policy has been driven by a desire to oust President Bashar al-Assad from power. Warnings of genocide in South Sudan&nbsp; A soldier in South Sudan, where conflict has persisted. Picture: Reuters In Africa, the most dramatic developments in terms of peace and security this year have been in South Sudan, where the situation has rapidly degenerated following the collapse of the peace deal which created a transitional government of national unity. It has become so dire that the UN is warning of the possibility of genocide.&nbsp; The UN secretary-general has sounded the alarm, warning that there is a real risk of mass atrocities, and stated that the existing 14 000 peacekeepers would be unable to prevent genocide. Tens of thousands have already been killed in the country s three-year civil war, and over 2 million displaced.&nbsp; The UN Security Council has authorised an additional Regional Protection Force of 4 000 troops from east Africa with a stronger mandate to keep the peace, although it is unclear where they will be adequately capacitated to do the job.&nbsp; The conflict has developed a distinctly ethnic tone, with atrocities and gross abuses of human rights being committed by all sides. In many areas of the country armed forces linked to the government have been accused of carrying out brutal campaigns of rapes, extrajudicial killings, abductions, torture, looting and the burning of homes, according to a UN panel of experts.&nbsp; Many civilians living in UN protection camps right next to UN bases have been killed while the UN commanders looked the other way.&nbsp; This led to the dismissal of the Kenyan commander of the UN peacekeeping mission this year by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.&nbsp; Politics of fear in Burundi&nbsp; The climate of fear in Burundi and the ongoing political persecution has driven hundreds of thousands of Burundians to flee to neighbouring countries.&nbsp; At least 300 000 Burundians have fled the country since the president announced his intention to serve a third term in April last year.&nbsp; According to human rights groups, more than 540 civilians have been executed.&nbsp; Africa s infrastructure build takes off&nbsp; Elaborate plans for the continent s infrastructure build were developed in 2015,but this year saw the road map begin to take shape across the continent.&nbsp; The Forum on China Africa co-operation in December last year had pledged significant resources to developing road, rail, port and airport facilities on the continent over the next three years.&nbsp; By the third quarter of this year the 753km Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway became operational, and the Mombasa-Nairobi railway will be operational next year. Plans to make South Africa the production base for the Africa rail network are also being implemented which will significantly boost the country s manufacturing output.&nbsp; Farewell to Fidel Castro&nbsp; Cuban President Fidel Castro points during his lengthy speech before the UN General Assembly, in New York, in 1979. Picture: Associated Press The death of Cuba s long-time leader Fidel Castro was one of the significant single events of the past year, which saw millions around the globe paying tribute to the international revolutionary, and the Miami lobby in the US celebrated his demise.&nbsp; Castro s legacy was roundly debated, but his passing also brought tributes to Cuba s immense contribution to Africa s liberation.&nbsp; Cuba s role in supporting the liberation struggles against the colonial powers in Algeria, Guinnea Bissau, Angola, and South Africa were extensively highlighted.&nbsp; In southern Africa a general consensus has emerged that Castro played a decisive role in turning the tide against the forces of apartheid.&nbsp; * Ebrahim is Group Foreign Editor The Sunday Independent
