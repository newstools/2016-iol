Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - Bikers call it a doughnut; it’s the mark left on the road after a tyre burnout. We don’t know what drifters call it but, according to the Guinness book of world records, this is the biggest one yet. It’s a giant image of the breast cancer awareness ribbon, laid out in the enormous car park of Saudi Arabian Ford distributor Al Jazirah Vehicle Agencies just outside Riyadh, by two drift-spec Mustang RTR-Ds, driven by Al Jazirah Ford Racing’s Abdulhadi Al-Qahtani and Muath Al-Essa. It took them 45 minutes, and several sets of specially made burnout tyres that not only generated huge clouds of pink smoke, but also left pink marks on the concrete, to create the image you see here, measuring an official 883.98 square metres in extent, earning them a Guinness world record and a lot of brownie points for raising awareness of breast cancer in one of the world’s most patriarchal cultures.
