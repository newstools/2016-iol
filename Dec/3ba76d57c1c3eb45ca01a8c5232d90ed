Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West's marriage was "strained" before his recent hospitalisation.  The 39-year-old was rushed to hospital in Los Angeles with suspected "temporary psychosis", brought on by exhaustion, in November but insiders claim they were having marriage problems ever before then.  A source told PEOPLE: "The divorce claims come from before he had the breakdown. She didn't know what was up with him and they weren't spending time together. She didn't know it was a mental breakdown.  And an insider recently revealed that Kanye didn't handle the "pressure" of fame very well and things had started going downhill for the rapper in late October.  A source said: "The pressure had gotten to him and he didn't handle it well. He made himself exhausted. But [the exhaustion] was a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself ... He wasn't making a lot of sense when he talked, and he was texting a lot of strange stuff to people. Not dangerous, but he just didn't make a lot of sense.  "Part of loving Kanye is that he sometimes is talking on a different level from you, and you just listen. But this was a lot more alarming. When Kanye gets like this, he doesn't sleep. So, you'd wake up to like 20 texts. The more tired he got from not sleeping, the less sense he was making. He wasn't in a good head space."  However, despite reports of trouble in their marriage, Kim, 36, and Kanye â€“ who have children North, three and 12-month-old Saint together, have no plans to split up.  An insider said: "Truly no truth behind divorce reports. It's not something she would divorce him over."  Bang Showbiz
