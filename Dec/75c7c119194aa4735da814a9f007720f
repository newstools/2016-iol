 Los Angeles – As you would have come to expect by now, the eighth "Fast and Furious" movie, renamed "The Fate of the Furious" is an explosive mix of speed, burnouts, chases and crazy stunts, with a wrecking ball thrown in for good measure, and there’s a big twist in the plot as lead character Dom Toretto goes rogue. Universal Pictures has released the first trailer for those that don’t mind a good spoiler and we see that SA’s Charlize Theron has been thrown into the mix as the temptress who convinces Dom to turn his back on his Fast and Furious family. The film also stars Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson and Jason Statham, and on a sad note it’s the first Fast and Furious film not to feature Paul Walker following the actor’s tragic death in 2013. The "The Fate of the Furious" is set to be released internationally in April 2017.
