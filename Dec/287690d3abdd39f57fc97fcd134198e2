To commemorate FCB's 90th anniversary in South Africa, we bring you some of the agency's best adverts.&nbsp; As a body of work, the years of ads for Toyota would have to receive my Grand Orchid.&nbsp; From the slogan &quot;Everything keeps going right&quot; (which is one of the best brand summations I have ever seen) to t he go-karts roaring down the hill;&nbsp; </p> to &quot;My dad's Hilux is tougher-er than yours&quot; </p> the sexy woman who nicks rally star Giniel De Villiers's racing Hilux and shows the boys how it should be done;&nbsp; </p> and last but not least Buddy, perhaps the most loved animal character in the history of South African advertising. </p> * Don't miss the FCB special commemorative supplement in the Saturday Star, Pretoria News, Weekend Argus and Independent on Saturday.
