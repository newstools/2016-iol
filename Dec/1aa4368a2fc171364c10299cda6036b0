Durban - Shoppers at City View in Greyville took cover early on Friday as four men were making their getaway after holding up a jewellery store. It is alleged that four men walked into the prominent jewellery store and used a hammer to smash open a display counter. The men took six trays of jewellery from the counter. A store owner nearby said he heard people screaming and what sounded like a gun shot go off. Traumatised staff were still inside the store while police took statements. Glass from the display cabinets was scattered inside the shop. Police Captain Nqobile Gwala said the robbery took place at 8.55am. She said a case of business robbery is being investigated.Daily News
