&quot;The shortlisted candidates will be subjected to an intensive vetting process to ensure that they comply with the Act. In this regard, interviewing of any candidate will be subject to candidates passing the extensive vetting process,&quot; the parliamentary committee said. &quot;Interviews for the shortlisted and vetted candidates will be conducted on the 25 January 2017. In an effort to promote a culture of openness, the CVs of shortlisted candidates will be published on the parliamentary website.&quot; The candidates are: Joy Maimela, Zandile Myeni, Zandile Majozi, Siyaduma Biniza, African National Congress Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela, Thembinkosi Josopu, Ndomiso Mokako, incumbent NYDA board chairman Yershen Pillay, Sifiso Mtsweni, Kenneth Morolong, Bavelile Hlongwa, Andile Biyela, Zilondiwe Goge and Siyabonga Magadla. The selection process was halted earlier this year to allow the committee to verify the ages and academic qualifications of the candidates after allegations of falsified qualifications and age cheating emerged.
