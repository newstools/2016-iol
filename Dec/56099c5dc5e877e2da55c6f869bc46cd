Johannesburg - The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) has promised to enhance its revenue stream by embarking on a process to develop a long-term vision for the management of the national road network. Sanral's new CEO Skhumbuzo Macozoma said the national roads agency wanted to engage with South Africans on achieving a balanced funding portfolio with fuel tax-based revenue and toll income. In a statement on Sunday, Macozoma also undertook to reach out to provincial and municipal governments, the private sector and civil society. &quot;The agency will pursue fresh engagements with relative provincial and municipal governments to ensure that road infrastructure planning is integrated and that Sanral programmes contribute to regional and local social and economic development,&quot; Macozoma said. &quot;We will explore progressive strategies to pursue partnerships with the private sector and civil society to ensure successful national road infrastructure development over the medium to long term.&quot; Read also: Revenue dip takes its toll on SanralMacozoma said this would bring certainty in terms of Sanral's borrowing plans and its capital project pipeline. In September, Moody's Investor Services placed Sanral's long-term and short-term issuer ratings on review for downgrade following the continuing deterioration of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP) known as e-tolls. Macozoma warned that deferred investment in maintenance and new roads construction projects would result in exponential cost growth in the future, with the maintenance backlog alone already standing at R197 billion. &quot;Sanral looks forward to 2017 as it embarks on this new journey as a servant of South Africans, committed to delivering on relevant projects, improving people s lives and contributing to economic growth through a balanced funding model,&quot; Macozoma said.AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
