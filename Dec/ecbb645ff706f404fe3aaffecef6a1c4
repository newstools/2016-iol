From the evidence given by the SABC 8 and former employees, it is clear that the SABC has also been captured by the Guptas, writes Dennis Bloem. If the ANC still believes that Jacob Zuma is the right leader for this country, then we are convinced as Cope that the ANC does not love this country, and it doesn t deserve to be in power.Cope has always suspected that the SABC has political handlers who are biased against all opposition parties and are using the SABC as the ANC broadcaster, and not a public broadcaster. This was exposed at the ad-hoc committee in Parliament.The evidence that has come before the parliamentary ad-hoc inquiry committee by former employees and the so-called SABC 8 is more than the word explosive , to say the least. While attention is given to Hlaudi Motsoeneng, he is just a pawn in the bigger scheme of things. From the evidence given by the SABC 8 and former employees of the broadcaster, it is clear that the SABC has also been captured by the Guptas.Cope calls upon the people to rise and defend our country and hard-earned democracy and never allow anybody to steal what belongs to us.* Dennis Bloem is Cope spokesman** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.The Mercury
