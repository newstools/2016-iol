Port Edward Two men and their dog were rescued after a boating accident in Port Edward on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Saturday. NSRI Port Edward duty crew and police search and rescue responded to under the R61 bridge over the Umtamvuna River in Port Edward at 6.30pm on Friday following reports of a boating accident, NSRI Port Edward station commander John Nicholas said on Saturday. &quot;On arrival on the scene we found that two Durban men that were on a 5.5 metre rigid inflatable boat had been thrown out the boat and reportedly not wearing a kill switch the boat had continued to motor around in circles and out of control unmanned on the river,&quot; he said. The two men had been rescued onto a ski-boat from The Pont that had launched to assist them and they were not injured. The men confirmed that only their dog Stella remained on the boat and they feared for their dogs safety. Stella could be seen lying down in the front of the boat, in front of the centre console, while the boat continued to motor in circles out of control. NSRI rescuers and the manager of The Pont Holiday and Watersport Resort Mike Davison, using two of The Pont s ski-boats, attempted to corral the boat. First by trying to get a rescuer on board the boat to stop the motor but when that failed ropes were trailed in the water fowling the casualty boat's propellors and finally stopping the motors, and an NSRI rescuer was able to board the boat. Stella was rescued and reunited with her owners and the boat was brought ashore. Nicholas commended Mike Davison of The Pont for his invaluable assistance during the operation. African News Agency
