Things had escalated to the killing of three people in a tuckshop, said department spokesman Sipho Khumalo. In a meeting attended by amakhosi, police management, local council leadership and community structures, it appeared that stock theft and criminality were rife in the area, the statement said.Among those caught in the crossfire were a Wits University student home for the holidays, and a 103-year-old woman. Even though the incidents happened in different places within the area, the modus operandi seem similar. Kaunda directed the police to ensure the perpetrators were caught soon. The situation here is shocking. We are told that the people of this area fear for their lives. What is even more worrying is that there are no clear reasons nor motives for these killings, hence the fact-finding mission today. We have called this urgent meeting to formulate a clear plan and strategy to bring an end to the killings and criminality in this area, Kaunda said. He called on the community to work with the police in their campaign to recover illegal firearms. As we approach New Year s Eve we urge people to enjoy themselves responsibly and refrain from violence . The Mercury
