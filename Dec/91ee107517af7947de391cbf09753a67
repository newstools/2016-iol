Johannesburg - Futuregrowth Asset
Management has recently invested R300 million in the SA Taxi's Zebra Cabs
service. The
money will help Zebra Cabs take on Uber and Taxify in Johannesburg first, then in other major
metros in due course. It aims to have 3 000 cabs on the road by 2020. Increased
competition in South Africa's

sector will have to grow significantly if all three ride-hailing services are
to thrive in the long-term. Read also: Uber eyeing more new markets in Africa In
