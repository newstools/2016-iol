Cape Town The West Coast ANC have expressed their anger at the response by Saldanha Bay municipality s mayor Marius Koen to claims of racist moves to restrict access to one of the beaches in the town. Now it has called for DA Western Cape leader Patricia de Lille to suspend Koen after he told the Cape Times in an interview that at times people arrived at the beach by taxi load, and bring with them noise, vandalism and drunkeness . ANC West Coast spokesperson Sammy Claasen said Koen s comments implied that black and coloured people in taxis at the beachfront were vandals, noisy and drunkards. This shows the Saldanha Bay mayor s racist attitude and outlook towards coloured and African people at beaches, said Claasen. Along with his suspension, the ANC also wants Koen to be investigated for his stereotypical racism . If the DA feels strongly about racism it should implement its so-called zero tolerance attitude and policy towards racism.The time has come to act, said Claasen. He said Koen s reasoning for the use of permit was racism in disguise, and it was simply an attempt to deny people from the mostly coloured area of Diazville access to the beach. What is at the core is the fact that white beachfront residence do not really want coloured and African people on the beaches close to their homes and streets. The DA is caught between a rock and a hard place and has been exposed as enforcing white privilege using municipal resources to restrict the movement of black people, said Claasen. He said the ANC would lay a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission against Koen, while demanding his immediate removal from office. Cape Times
