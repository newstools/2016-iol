Johannesburg - The Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) said on Wednesday it had received a R2 million donation from the government of India. &quot;The donation will support the foundation in fulfilling its noble objectives of helping build our democracy, human rights and peace in the days to come,&quot; said the NMF. &quot;The donation is in recognition of the importance of the foundation in preserving the legacy of the great leader Nelson Mandela.&quot; The donation was handed to NMF CEO Sello Hatang by India's High Commissioner to South Africa, Ruchi Ghanashyam. &quot;We are grateful for the support of the government of India. It again confirms our close ties and solidarity beyond boundaries,&quot; said Hatang. The NMF was founded by former president Nelson Mandela in 1999. The much loved statesman died on 5 December in 2013. The organisation provided the base for Mandela's charitable work, from building schools to HIV/AIDS work to peace and reconciliation interventions. It also played a role in the building of the recently completed Mandela Children's Hospital. The foundation has begun its transition into an organisation focused on memory, dialogue and legacy work.
