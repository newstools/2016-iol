Cape Town - It seems desperate worshippers will swallow anything, not just Doom insect killer being sprayed in people s faces in church.In the past week, the world has learnt that holy men use Dettol and sewage water to bless their flock, while others, like Bishop Daniel Obinim of Ghana, has a more hands-on approach.Obinim claims he has been blessed with godly powers to enlarge a man s penis, and a woman s breasts, just by touching them. In footage broadcast on his own TV channel, Obinim TV, the Bishop says: If you want big buttocks I can do it for you, if you want big breasts, I can help. If you have a small manhood, I can change them all when I come to the spiritual realm. And his male flock has been lining up for his special touch as footage shows the preacher pressing his hands against men s crotches, two at a time.Obinim is the founder of God s Way Church. Sadly, no one has yet come forward to prove his methods to be effective.In Harare, Zimbabwe, self-styled prophet, Paul Sanyangore, has been feeding his flock sewage water to cleanse themselves.The group apparently needed to drink water but a nearby shop was closed.Sanyangore then went to fetch the faeces water, and prayed over it before adding some salt.He then drank the sewage water himself before his followers also took turns to quench their thirst.The holy man even went to speak about the experience on a local radio station where he was a guest.Meanwhile, a Limpopo pastor has a more clinical approach.Prophet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church in Makgodu made his congregants drink Dettol to heal them of their illnesses.The prophet said he knew the antiseptic fluid was harmful but that God had instructed him to use it. The incidents come a week after the Limpopo health department obtained a court interdict ordering Prophet of Doom Lethebo Rabalago, 24, of Mount Zion General Assembly and his church members to refrain from spraying the insect killer on people.Rabalago claimed Doom can cure illnesses like cancer.
