Atlanta An Atlanta couple has decided to pay it forward by filling their wedding registry with toys and other items to be donated to sick children and their families.WAGA-TV reports that Kristin Klingshirn is a personality on &quot;The Bert Show,&quot; a syndicated radio morning show. Klingshirn says she and fiance Bart Mattingly decided they didn't need the normal items included on a wedding registry.So they decided to use it to raise donations for Bert's Big Adventure, a nonprofit that provides Walt Disney World trips for kids with chronic and terminal illnesses and their families.Supporters have bought more than 3,200 gifts for the charity so far, and Klingshirn says she plans to keep adding items to the registry.Associated Press
