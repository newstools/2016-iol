Russelsheim, Germany – Genesis, the new luxury brand of Korean group Hyundai / Kia, has hired ex-Bugatti designer Alexander Selipanov to head the Global Genesis Advanced Studio in Germany. Russian-born ‘Sasha’ Selipanov, 33, studied in California before joining the Volkswagen Design Centre in Potsdam, Germany in 2005 as part of the exterior design team. In 2010 he moved to Sant'Agata, Italy, to join the Lamborghini exterior design team for the Huracan, and in 2014 he became head of exterior design at Bugatti, where he was responsible for the Vision Gran Turismo show car and the Chiron. “Genesis will be a new and refreshing challenge,“ he said. “Up to now, I’ve been working with well-established brands, but this will be a rare opportunity chance to launch a new luxury car and be part of its history.” Selipanov will start at Genesis in January 2017, reporting directly to head of design Luc Donckerwolke.
