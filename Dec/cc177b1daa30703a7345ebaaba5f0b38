Bujumbura One of the eight security forces agents suspected of assassinating General Adolph Nshimirimana, the former Intelligence Director close to Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza, escaped on Tuesday evening. Police announced that the suspect escaped after having shot to death a prison security agent. The Public Information Officer at the National Police, Pierre Nkurikiye, told the African News Agency (ANA) that the incident happened when the victim was escorting the suspect to the bank to withdraw money. He said the criminal had used a pistol to kill the police agent before he ran away and had not been apprehended at the time of this story. &quot;We still don't know how he managed to get the firearm but investigations are already underway,&quot; he said. The next hearing of the remaining suspects had been fixed for 27 December. The eight are accused of planning and carrying out the assassination of the general. Senior presidential advisor for internal security and close ally of President Nkurunziza, General Nshimirimana was killed on 2 August 20015 in a rocket attack on his car. The attack was carried out by a heavily armed commando in the capital Bujumbura. African News Agency
