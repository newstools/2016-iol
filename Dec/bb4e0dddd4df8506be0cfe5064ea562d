Cape Town - While visiting the offices of Independent Media on Friday, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane announced that in 2017 she will launch an investigation into free sanitary pads for girls. The Public Protector believes that young girls should be afforded free sanitary pads, especially seeing how the government provides free condoms to prevent HIV infection.&nbsp; &quot;Government is providing free condoms to deal with the scourge of HIV/Aids,&quot; Mkhwebane stated. &quot;I've seen in one article where some teenagers in Limpopo are exposing themselves to prostitution just to have money to buy the sanitary pads.&quot; While Mkhwebane is ready to take on the task, she is aware that it will not be a overnight process. &quot;It will take time, because it is about their policies so the department of health will have to look into their policies, look into the budgetary process, so it will be a long process, but then we will have to engage with them.&quot; &nbsp; IOL Mojo
