Johannesburg - Opel has taken a sho't left with its Mokka compact crossover, tacking an X on to the name with the explanation that all future Opel crossovers and SUV's will be identified like that. Along with the name change, however, comes a revised front treatment, courtesy of new headlight clusters that combine daytime running lamps and LED headlights. The interior has been updated too, with a new dashboard layout derived from that of the new Astra, new upholstery fabrics in two different shades of black - and, of course, upgraded gizmotronics. The model line-up is unchanged, however, with two trim levels - Enjoy and Cosmo - each with Opel's 1.4-litre Ecotec turbopetrol four (103kW from 4900-6000rpm and 200Nm from 1850-4900rpm, in case you'd forgotten) and a choice of six-speed transmissions in either manual or self-shifting format. So is performance, quoted as before at 0-100 in 9.8 seconds for the manual and 10.7 for the auto, tops speeds of 196 and 191km/h respectively and nominal fuel consumption of between 5.9 and 6.5 litres per 100km. The Cosmo gets a new infotainment system with R4.0 IntelliLink, a driver display and a USB port, which is also available as a R6700 option on the base Enjoy models. Optional on the Cosmo only is a further R10 700 upgrade, to the Navi 900 IntelliLink with satnav - as its name suggests - and colour display, as well as a sunroof (R6500) and a R25 000 premium LED lighting set-up that includes self-levelling adaptive headlights with integrated cornering lights, and LED tail-light clusters. Prices Mokka X 1.4T Enjoy - R317 500 Mokka X 1.4T Enjoy AT - R328 400 Mokka X 1.4T Cosmo - R357 400 Mokka X 1.4T Cosmo AT - R368 100 These include a five-year or 120 000km warranty and a five-year or 90 000km service plan linked to 15 000km service intervals.
