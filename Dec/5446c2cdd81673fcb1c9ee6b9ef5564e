I was with a friend. We were parked on Kereke Street in Extension 7, outside a friend s house. We were sitting in the car talking when two men approached us from behind, he said. One of the men pulled out a firearm and they forced us to look down. The men chased my friend away, they told him to get out and go, he explained.Mkhize said the men then demanded the car keys and they pushed him into the passenger seat. My face was covered with a balaclava and they drove away with me until we arrived at an unknown house. They forced me into a dark room; it was empty, while they looked for and disabled the tracker device. After some time the men returned and forced him back into the car. Eventually they dropped him off on the R550 after driving around with him for some time.After driving away he managed to get to the local police where he reported the matter.The car was identified as a white Mercedes with a small EFF insignia on its side.Rossouw said that according to Mkhize the car was worth about R280 000. A case of hijacking has been opened. As of yet no suspects have been arrested, however our investigations are continuing, Rossouw added.Anyone with information that will assist in apprehending the perpetrators is encouraged to contact police.[email&#160;protected] @Lanc_02The Star
