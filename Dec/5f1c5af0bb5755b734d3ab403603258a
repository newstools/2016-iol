Durban - Toy guns, one of which had been modified into a working weapon, have been used in crimes in KwaZulu-Natal. A firearm expert said that while the conversion was easy , it was also dangerous.The toy gun which had been &shy;converted to a working firearm was found on a suspect on Tuesday by the eThekwini South Cluster Task Team. The cluster s spokeswoman, Priya Nunkumar, said the task team apprehended the suspect in Welbedacht East after a tip-off. The team recovered a modified toy firearm, along with four rounds of ammunition and four blank rounds of ammunition. The suspect was detained at Chatsworth police station and appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrate s Court on Wednesday. Gun Owners South Africa spokesman Paul Oxley said that modifying a toy gun or making improvised weapons was so easy , but that generally such weapons could only be used once. It might go bang once or twice before it blows up in the shooter s hand. It would have no accuracy beyond point blank range, but could certainly be lethal, said Oxley.He added that manufacturing any device that could be classified as a firearm was a crime. In another crime involving a toy gun, a family was hijacked in Mooi River on Wednesday at about midday. KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokeswoman Thembeka Mbhele said a 45-year-old man, his wife and their two children were driving in the Giant s Castle area when they were accosted by two men with a firearm, a hammer and knives. Mbhele said the suspects got into the car and drove around with them until late afternoon when they stopped at a garage in Lyell Street, Ladysmith. The parents and one of the children escaped, but the suspects drove off with the couple s 9-year-old son. The vehicle was later found along the N3 at the Wagendrift turnoff near Estcourt, and the child rescued. The gun, found with other weapons, turned out to be a toy, said Mbhele. Independent on Saturday
