Johannesburg - Kibo Mining on Wednesday entered into a binding term sheet with the US-based asset managers, Sanderson Capital Partners, for a new $2.94 million forward payment facility to be paid in five tranches between now and June 2017. This comes after the Tanzania-focused mineral exploration and development company in March raised &pound;1.5 million through an interest-free loan arrangement with Sanderson to complete a definitive feasibility study for the proposed Mbeya coal-to-power project (MCPP). Kibo is on the brink of developing a 250-350 MW mouth-of-mine thermal power station in its power and coal mine elements the MPCC in south-western Tanzania. This new facility provides for Kibo to be advanced part of the $3.67 million development cost recovery, payable to the company by SEPCO III on achieving financial close of the MCPP as announced by the company in October. As a result, Kibo would issue new ordinary shares to Sanderson to the value of $732 036 over the 30 days while Sanderson would have the right to convert up to &pound;1.5 million of the amount drawn down on the facility into Kibo shares.Read also: Kibo Mining completes financial modelCEO Louis Coetzee said it was pleased with the facility because it would allow the mining company to create short- to medium-term funding certainty in a market that remained challenging for capital raising.Coetzee said the facility would also provide Kibo a funding solution with minimal dilution to shareholders.&quot;The funds which have been made available will satisfy the company's cash requirements for a significant time, allowing management to focus all their time and energy on bringing the MCPP to a successful financial close as early as possible in 2017, as well as concluding the Opera transaction and complete the planned feasibility work on the Imweru gold project as scheduled,&quot; Coetzee said.AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
