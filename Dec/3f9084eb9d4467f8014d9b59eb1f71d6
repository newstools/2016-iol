Factionalism tearing the ANC apart has spilt into the ranks of the military veterans, but the party can be mended, writes Mogomotsi Mogodiri.The 55th anniversary commemorations of Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) were marred by controversy and deep divisions within the ranks of former combatants.It is unfortunate that the factionalism tearing the ANC apart has spilt into the ranks of the military veterans, and what was meant to be a moment of deep reflection on the selflessness of former combatants was overshadowed by heckling and tussles between those who want to perpetuate the status quo of corruption, nepotism, self-centredness, denialism and arrogance and those who aim to disinfect (to borrow Joel Netshitendze s terminology) the ANC of all that is causing the cancer that is eating away the soul of the ANC.First, it was the marginalisation and neglect of genuine former MK combatants while young men are paraded as military veterans. As if that isn t insult enough, then came the announcement that the likes of Hlaudi Motsoeneng, Brian Molefe and Dudu Myeni disgraced individuals implicated in corruption and state capture will be honoured as part of the activities to commemorate the establishment of MK. Former combatants had had enough and they ensured that the rich legacy of selflessness, service to the people, uprightness and commitment to the cause wasn t defaced. They rejected the ill-conceived awards, and the rest is history.These former combatants then convened an unprecedented national council to conduct a diagnosis of not only the MK Military Veterans Association (MKMVA), but also the ANC Veterans League and, most importantly, the ANC itself.How refreshing to listen to and participate in frank, robust discussions about the ills festering within these organisations, and what needed to be done to urgently and decisively cure the ANC s self-inflicted wounds, given its role as the leader of not only its constituent parts but its alliance partners and the rest of South Africa.With less distracting singing and rhetoric, a scene was set by both the opening address and the political overview that critically looked at how, as the ANC family, we have contributed, by omission or commission, to the morass the organisation finds itself in.The political overview went even further, to present a prognosis that pointed to a bleak future for the ANC and the country unless urgent and decisive steps are taken to change the self-destructive trajectory the current ANC leadership is pursuing.Joined by the legendary +101 stalwarts and veterans, the more than 2000 delegates then knuckled down to deeply examining the causes of the crisis, and how the envisaged national consultative conference (NCC) might assist in restoring the ANC to its former glory. Focus also fell on the dysfunctionality of the ANC Veteran League and the rogue behaviour and posture of the MKMVA. There were no holy cows and no punches were pulled as delegates dissected the problems besetting their organisations. They touched on areas ranging from the relevance of the ANC constitution to the quality of membership, the conduct and behaviour of leadership and even the requirements to qualify to become an ANC leader.Former commanders, commissars and combatants were clear in their minds that they will not let their organisations be destroyed by those with nefarious intentions. They also made it clear that they will not let their country go to waste. Hence, it was resolved that all former combatants must play an active role in the renewal programme of the ANC. The former combatants are offended by the institutionalisation of factions, entrenched denialism and associated arrogance, gate-keeping and vote-buying, and the insatiable lust for power and crass materialism ravaging the ANC. Corruption, self-centredness and the general loss of the moral compass by some in ANC ranks did not escape them. As the annus horribilis of the party comes to a close, it is refreshing that veterans and stalwarts are holding hands with former combatants in an honest effort to pull the ANC from the brink. As we usher in 2017, the 105th anniversary of the oldest liberation movement on the African continent, we expect concerted political efforts to ensure that the proposed NCC will be as broad as possible to include sectors beyond the natural ANC-aligned organisations, given that the ANC is a leader of society and the rest of society must participate fully in that process. A push for the delinking of the national policy and consultative conferences will be another matter that will come under the microscope as combatants, like the stalwarts and veterans, feel that sufficient distance between the dates of convening the respective conferences will ensure that ANC members internalise and formulate views on how the outcomes of the NCC should influence the deliberations of the national policy conference, and by extension, the elective conference later in the year.Concerted efforts will also see both the MKMVA and ANC Veterans League conferences being held and attended by genuine members and focusing on issues relevant to their members, who will agree on ways to strengthen their organisations. In convening these conferences, including the NCC, former combatants want to be part of their preparatory or steering committees so as to inform the form, content and shape of these gatherings so that they don t degenerate into divisive, irrelevant talk-shops. Former combatants are impatient with the rot that has set in across ANC ranks and are committed to formulate and implement a turnaround programme (including how the ANC elects its leaders and vetting) that will restore the ANC s public image and standing as a credible and visionary leader of society. Given the frank and robust spirit that prevailed throughout the MK veterans national council, there is a glimmer of hope that the ANC will be pulled from the abyss and our country returned to a healthy development trajectory. Let us fasten our seatbelts as 2017, while being tumultuous politically, promises to be a groundbreaking and epoch-making year for not only the ANC but also our country.* Mogodiri is a former MK combatant, ANC member, media specialist and a public servant, writing in his personal capacity** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.The Star
