Durban - Tributes are pouring in for internationally acclaimed military historian, author and specialist battlefield tour guide, Ken Gillings, who died in a snorkelling tragedy on Friday.One of the tributes sent to his family in Pinetown came from Alexander Perkins, the great-grandson of the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Gilling s wife Heather said on Sunday night.Another came from the IFP president, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who praised Gillings for being a remarkable historian, for whom I had great respect .Gillings, 69, died while snorkelling at Cape Vidal during a holiday with his family.He had arrived the day before with his wife and the couple had been given the holiday in a log cabin as a Christmas treat by their son, Douglas, and his wife, Kim. We normally camped or stayed in a caravan. It had been a really lovely family time, his wife recalled. Just hours before the tragedy, Gillings posted pictures of the family, along with his 3-year-old grandson Ethan, on his Bush and Battlefield Tours Facebook page.Gillings lost the battle for his life after being sucked in by a rip current. He tried to swim back, but couldn t battle against those odds , his wife said His son swam out to save him and his daughter-in-law raced with a bodyboard to bring him back to the shore, but by the time they got to him, it was too late. We don t actually know what happened. The doctor suspects that because of his age, he might have panicked and had some sort of heart arrest, but there will be a post-mortem on Monday (today) to find out, his wife said.She could not keep track of all the tributes that were coming in, she said.They were also being received by Colonel Pat Acutt, the senior staff officer of the KZN Defence Reserves, who soldiered with Gillings for more than 40 years. I am really mortified by his death, he said, recalling that Gillings was a noted expert on the Anglo-Boer and Anglo-Zulu wars and many of the condolence messages were from tourists as well as military men from around the world who had been part of Gillings s inspirational battlefield tours to find out about their unit s fallen soldiers. Gillings had also led tours to North Africa and Europe. He kept history alive for the next generation and also reminded people not to forget, Acutt said.Gillings had tours booked up to 2018, with his latest book, The Road To Ulundi Revisited, evoking a lot of interest. Gillings spent three years identifying and photographing the sites depicted in paintings in the original book, providing the explanatory notes.The IFP leader said last night that he first met Gillings when the South African Military History Society hosted an international conference on the 130th commemoration of Isandlwana and Rorke s Drift. I was impressed by his insight into the battles of the Anglo-Zulu War and admired how he captured the pathos of the battlefield, without emotively favouring either side, he said.He had been honoured to be asked to write the foreword to one of Gillings s books, Discovering the Battlefields of the Anglo-Zulu War, especially as the author had undertaken a monumental task of meticulous research&quot;. I am haunted by the thought that we lost Mr Gillings the day after a statue of my great-grandfather, King Cetshwayo, was unveiled at the Castle of Good Hope. That event had led me to reread Mr Gillings book, and I had been delighted all over again by his attention to detail and obvious love for his work. Acutt said that apart from Gillings being the past Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) of the Natal Field Artillery, he also served with me as my RSM in the Reserve Force Division .Gillings was the secretary of the Durban Branch of the South African Military History Society, and one of the society s greatest stalwarts , the national chairman Jan-Willem Hoorweg said.Gillings was the secretary of the Durban branch of the Gunners Association of South Africa for more than 40 years and was made a national honorary life vice president earlier this year.He also ran the Association s Facebook page, and posted regular battlefield happenings on his Bush and Battlefield Tours Facebook page.He chaired the Anglo-Boer War Centenary Committee in KZN; had just retired as the Old Bill (chairman) of the Winston Churchill Moth Shellhole in Westville - where Churchill s great-grandson visited several years ago - and was an active member of the Westville Rotarians, receiving the Rotarians Paul Harris Award for his work involving Zulu culture even before becoming a Rotarian.In terms of his will, there will be no official memorial service.However, the Winston Churchill Shellhole will pay tribute to him by holding a sunset parade on Tuesday at 7.30pm at the shellhole.Daily News
