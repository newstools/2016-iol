The past two weeks in Parliament have been nothing short of riveting viewing - paradoxically - of the grilling of the leadership, past and present, of the public broadcaster.This week it was the turn of the SABC 8, brave journalists who drew a line in the sand earlier this year and spoke out about the mismanagement and interference they experienced. They were vilified, intimidated, suspended, fired and then reinstated. This week they had their moment at the parliamentary ad hoc inquiry into the SABC.Faith Muthambi behaved like Marie AntoinetteThey were followed by Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, who behaved like Marie Antoinette, absolving herself of any liability in the face of a tsunami of testimony to the contrary.We have heard not just of state capture but of broadcast capture. We have heard the names of those accused of inappropriate contact and meddling in the affairs of cabinet ministers mentioned in a similar context at the SABC. Although the SABC has long been on a slippery slope in terms of public accountability, the situation at Auckland Park is far bleaker than previously indicated, the level of interference far worse and the reign of fear downright dire.What will Parliament do in the new year?Hlaudi Motsoeneng appears down but not out and the minister remains in office. There is no board, except for a lone chairman, whose appearance at the committee has been parlous.The SABC hearing has been cathartic in many ways and indicated how well Parliament can work when MPs look beyond sectarian party interests to work together, but now the question is: what next?Motsoeneng should be charged, Muthambi fired and a brand new board established. Also critical is that a new SABC leadership understands its role as a public broadcaster, not his master s voice, and is allowed to get on with this task without undue interference from political heavyweights.Weekend Argus
