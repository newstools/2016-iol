Cape Town - The end of the school academic year has brought anything but relief for a mother who is battling to find placement for her child for next year.Single mother Zenobia Errington, from Diep River, says her child is supposed to start Grade 1 in the new year, but even though she applied timeously at several schools in her area, she does not know what will happen come January.Errington s daughter was enrolled in Grade R at a Plumstead school, and in February this year Errington became active in attempting to find a school for her daughter.She applied at Westcott Primary, which is directly across the road from her house, and at Bergvliet Primary, less than 3km from where she lives.Following unsuccessful applications there, Errington said she also applied at Plumstead Prep, and approached Fairview Primary School Grassy Park to ask them to accommodate her child.Several calls for intervention from the Western Cape Education Department were fruitless, Errington said.She now wondered if she is being discriminated against because of her monthly earnings. I was told by those schools that her placement was not guaranteed, and we were put on the waiting list Why is it that I have to wait till January to finally be assisted? I did everything by the book, yet to my surprise I was still disappointed to find out I have not been accepted at any of the schools I have completed registration for. Errington added. So how do I explain to my daughter that her single parented mother who is earning less than R6 000 a month and who pays R2 100 a month for cr&egrave;che fees, could not find a school willing to accept her? she asked.Education MEC Debbie Sch&auml;fer s spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, said school governing bodies determined their own admissions policy, and the department did not apply feeder zones.
