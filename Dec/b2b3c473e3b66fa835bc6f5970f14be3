Banjul - Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is heading a mediation delegation to Gambia on behalf of West Africa's ECOWAS bloc, said no deal had been reached on Tuesday to end a deepening political crisis.&quot;It is not time for a deal. It is not something that can happen in one day. It is something we have to work on,&quot; she said after a round of meetings that included talks with incumbent president Yahya Jammeh and president-elect Adama Barrow.&nbsp; Reuters
