Johannesburg - South Africa’s hottest MC’s list has been released and Bhut’Fill Up, Cassper Nyovest, occupied the number 1 spot comfortably, taking the title for the second time in a row. The full list was revealed in a roundtable format this past Thursday and Friday, in a panel discuss that constituted of South African hiphop giants and influencers namely veteran rapper Amu, founding member of the hip hop group Skwatta Kamp Slikour,  UJFM radio presenter Spokenpriestess and Shiz Live‘s content producer Rashid Kay. The annual list, according to MTV’s description, looks at those who made headline news within the music industry and deserve the mention. MTV based the criteria of judging on six pointers by which the panelists  weighed up against which are: “impact, lyrics, sales, buzz, style and other ‘intangibles’ - everything else outside the recording perimeters, achievements and what was done that other MCees aren’t.” Second on the list is Mtee and Nasty C coming up as three. Even with such giants judging the list of potentials winners to make up the top ten, twitter’ville is not at all happy with the outcome of the list. Mixed responses from fans filled twitter, especially regarding the results of Super Mega, AKA after placing at number five on the list. Some reckon he deserves the number five spot while some are left puzzled at his rating. The MTV listing follows days before the 2016 SA Hip Hop Awards (SAHHA) that will take place on the 14th December at Gold Reef City's, Lyric Theatre.
