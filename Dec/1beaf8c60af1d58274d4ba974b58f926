To commemorate FCB's 90th anniversary in South Africa, we bring you some of the agency's best adverts. Sometimes animals in ads are cute - as with the brilliant Bobby, who searches all over town for a bottle with his name on it - but sometimes they cause ructions, as when the Cell C dog annoyed a few Mother Grundys with his rather forthright commitment to the man's leg. The ad got laughs all over the place, though... </p> </p> * Don't miss the FCB special commemorative supplement in the Saturday Star, Pretoria News, Weekend Argus and Independent on Saturday.
