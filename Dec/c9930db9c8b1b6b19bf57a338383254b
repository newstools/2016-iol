Cape Town - While it is was fun in the sun for most of youngsters, some experienced a bumpy start to Plett Rage. About 50 matriculants allegedly fell victim to an accommodation scam. Not only were they duped out of thousands of rands, they were left stranded without accommodation for the festival period. According to parents of some of the youngsters, they had booked accommodation through a property management company but when the students showed up on Friday, the property was not available and the booking agent not contactable. Mother of a youngster, Jacqui Luck from East London, said they had paid R34 500 for a group of ten youngsters. “Some of the teenagers in the group paid their share through holiday jobs and hard work throughout the year,” Luck said. She added that on Wednesday she followed up with the company about whether the youngsters should bring their own bedding. “We were told that all was in order and that they just needed to bring swimming towels. “When I phoned today the number provided was no longer available.” She said the teenagers showed up at the property but were informed that it had been booked for the period by others. Luck said they reported the matter to the police. Plettenberg Bay Tourism spokesman Patty Butterworth said they believed about 50 youngsters had fallen victim to the scam. Plett Rage organisers and residents however came to their rescue. Some residents offered free accommodation for them at their own homes while organisers offered free accommodation for the youngsters at the Rage Village at Forever Resort just out Plettenberg Bay.
