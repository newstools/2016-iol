The various zones will spring to life from 6.30pm onwards, with activities and entertainment from buskers, cirque performances, roaming musicians, singers and live bands, to dance performances, floats, entertainers, and much more. More than 80 restaurants and eateries will be open on the evening, and additional food trucks will be nestled across the property to cater for all manner of hunger pangs on the night. Entertainment zones The V&A Amphitheatre will be decorated in white to reflect the air and wind theme at this zone. Decorated with fairy lights completing the ethereal look. Entertainment in this area will be provided by live bands, dancers and acrobats performing aerial feats of amazement.

Traffic and parking Given the popularity of the V&A Waterfront's annual New Year party, parking fills up quickly, and traffic congestion in the city can make getting into the Waterfront difficult. Visitors are encouraged to use the MyCiTi bus service as an alternative. The last bus departs from Breakwater Boulevard at the V&A Waterfront at 1am. Visitors who prefer to arrive by car are encouraged to park at the Silo District, which is just a five minute stroll from the Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre and other activities on offer. For anyone travelling from the Atlantic Seaboard, the quickest route is via Granger Bay Boulevard. A hint for visitors who wish to park at Breakwater Parking Garage - take the Beach Road entrance into the Breakwater Parking Garage for a quicker route. This is a quick stroll across the road to Entrance 2 of the Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre.
