Johannesburg The ANC Youth League will agitate the ANC-led government to pass laws that would pull the plug on white power, privilege and arrogance.It wants racists jailed for a minimum of 10 years, saying the time for picketing and marching against the social ill was now over.The Young Lions also wanted to temper with the current ownership structure of Africa s biggest economy so as to undermine white supremacy .ANCYL national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said government should move with speed in expropriating land and in transforming Africa s most industrialised nation. We must put sustained pressure on the ANC government to create a regulatory framework to do this, he said in a statement released on Tuesday. He said they had noted the increased number of racist incidents in public spaces, restaurants, schools and beaches.On Monday, Independent Media ran a story about how the Saldanha Bay municipality had issued passes to residents living in close proximity to the beachfront while barricading out those who didn t live in the residential area.DA mayor Marius Koen said the move was aimed at maintaining law and order as visitors sometimes arrived by the taxi-load, resulting in noise, vandalism and drunkenness .Mkhize said: This signals a resurgence of racial arrogance that once again proclaims white supremacy ... these racist incidents ... show a deeper underlying racial hatred that continues to exist in our society. He said the fact that economy was predominantly owned by whites is what continues to feed the arrogance shown by racists . Black people are lacking in material power as a result of centuries long dispossession whilst the majority of white racists believe their economic standing in society continues to make them a superior race, he added.[email&#160;protected] @luyolomkentanePolitical Bureau
