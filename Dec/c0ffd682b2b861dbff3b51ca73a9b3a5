Durban - The world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch (AB) InBev, on Wednesday continued the offloading spree of some of its major operations, announcing that it would transfer its 54.5 percent stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) to the New York-listed parent organisation, the Coca-Cola Company, for $3.15 billion (R44.36 billion).The sale of CCBA brings to three the number of operations InBev had sold in just under two weeks for a combined value of $11.45 billion.Last week InBev disposed of its five brewing assets in eastern Europe to the Asahi Group Holdings for $7.8 billion and followed this with a 26.4 percent sale of the Distell stake in South Africa to the Public Investment Corporation within three days in a deal worth $565 million.The latest CCBA deal got both sides excited about the outcome, with Carlos Brito, chief executive of AB InBev, stating: We are happy that we have been able to reach this agreement with the Coca-Cola Company in a timely manner and with a satisfactory outcome for all parties. Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, agreed: We are pleased to have reached an agreement quickly that is in everyone s best interests. We will move forward with our long-term strategic plan in these important growth markets. We are continuing negotiations with a number of parties who are highly qualified and interested in these bottling territories and look forward to refranchising these territories as soon as practical following regulatory approval. The disposal of the Coca-Cola stake did not come as a surprise as the market expected the company to offload more of its non-core assets in the near future to streamline its operations.Read also: AB InBev sells out of Coca-Cola for R44bnThe selling of CCBA operations included Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Mayotte and the Comoros.The companies also reached an agreement for Coca-Cola to buy AB InBev s bottling interests in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras for an undisclosed amount.There is speculation that AB InBev is eying the US beverage giant Coca-Cola as its next acquisition target.If the deal materialises, AB InBev can expect to add a giant with a market capitalisation of more than $176 billion to its stable, according to the analysts, after snatching South Africa s SABMiller in a deal worth R1.5 trillion last year. Sasha Naryshkine, an analyst at Vestact, said AB InBev would continue to sell the non-core assets that do not fit with its strategy. The acquisition of AB InBev s 54.5 percent stake in the venture provides a firm footing in a region that is probably one of the last where it can grow its core soft drinks products, said Naryshkine. Considering the speed that this deal was done I would expect AB InBev to continue selling non-core assets quickly. It is a good price for Coca-Cola. AB InBev shares gained 0.55percent on the JSE yesterday to close at R1 456.- Additional reporting by BloombergBUSINESS REPORT
