Cape Town - Despite only opening in the Cape Town CBD in April this year, NOMAD Bistro Fusion has quickly established a reputation as an innovative, exciting addition to the city’s competitive foodie scene. Serving globally-inspired fusion food and cocktails in a bistro bar setting, NOMAD Bistro Fusion is a passion project for the management team. “We set out to create a relaxed space where visitors could catch up over inspired food and speciality drinks,” says Mohit Sureka, one of the owners. “The decor reflects the inspiration for the menu – travel – and we’ve been working hard to establish a setting which showcases our love for food and good vibes”. The menu at NOMAD Bistro Fusion is inspired by local ingredients, with options for day or evening dining, including seasonal tapas; ‘Nomadic Burgers’ with global flavours and ‘flammkuchen-styled’ flatbreads with fusion ingredients for sharing - and decadent dessert deals including chocolate brownie ice cream; coconut ice cream with chai spices; creme anglaise and home made sorbets.
