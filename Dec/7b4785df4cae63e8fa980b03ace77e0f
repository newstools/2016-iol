Pretoria - Group Five shares slipped 4.56 percent on Wednesday after the listed construction and engineering group reported it expected to report a loss in headline earnings a share of at least 170 cents for the six months to December.Shares in Group Five closed 4.56 percent lower at R26.35 yesterday, after closing on Tuesday at R27.61.In February, the group reported a 21 percent increase in fully diluted headline earnings a share to 131c for the six months to December from 108c reported in the previous corresponding period.The group attributed the share loss to the recognition of its financial socio-economic contribution of R255 million in terms of the agreement reached with the government to implement a programme of initiatives that would significantly accelerate transformation of the South African construction sector, the commercial close out and final settlement of certain long outstanding contracts and a disappointing performance by its engineering and construction cluster.The agreement with the government involved seven listed construction companies and settled their exposure to potential damages claims from public entities for collusion and bid-rigging offences.Read also: Group Five 'pleased' with resultsGroup Five said although its socio-economic contribution payments would occur annually at R21.25 million a year over a 12-year period, the total liability must be recorded in the group s current reporting period, because it was the period in which the liability had been incurred.The group attributed the particularly disappointing performance of the engineering and construction cluster to continued weak trading conditions that impacted the civil engineering, projects and energy segments, resulting in a subdued order intake, and contract losses affecting mainly the projects segment and materially impacting the segment s performance due to contract operational difficulties.The group said the engineering and construction cluster also experienced subdued tendering activity in the mining and oil and gas sectors, which had placed projects under continued pressure. Although bidding activity in the power sector remains buoyant, the length of time taken to achieve contract awards resulted in no new awards materialising in the first six months of the financial year, impacting profitability for this segment, the group said.It added that its focus in the current period was on the commercial close-out and final settlement of previously-disclosed long outstanding South African contracts to remove non-performing assets and improve the group s balance sheet and its return on capital going forward.BUSINESS REPORT
