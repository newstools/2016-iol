Johannesburg - Dual listed junior lithium miner Tawana Resources says shareholders have given it the go ahead for a new Australian venture.This follows a statement on December 20 in which it said it had completed due diligence on Bald Hill Mine and decided to exercise its option to acquire Lithco.However, this was subject to a shareholders vite, which was held on Friday.As a result, Tawana will become the joint venture partner of Alliance Mineral Assets in the Bald Hill Lithium and Tantalum Project.Tawana said Lithco had entered into a farm-in and JV with Singapore-listed AMAL for the purpose of exploration and joint exploitation of lithium and other minerals at the Bald Hill Mine, which includes a processing plant, existing infrastructure and permitted mining licences. The acquisition of Lithco potentially allows Tawana to become an Australian spodumene producer in the second half of 2017, it said earlier this week.Tawana said there are extensive spodumene pegmatites in wide-spaced drilling, which indicates significant tonnage potential, over and above existing tantalum reserves.Read also: Tawana to sell out of diamondsIts research also found high spodumene recoveries and high concentrate grades from initial metallurgical test-work.As a result, it said, there are early indications of a highly profitable operation and rapid payback period at the Bald Hill Mine.MD Mark Calderwood said the Bald Hill Mine represents a unique opportunity for the company to quickly enter the spodumene supply chain with modest capital expenditure at a time when demand is strongly outpacing uncommitted supply. Engineering in the New Year will focus on fast-tracking completion of the feasibility focused on installation of a DMS circuit and rescheduling of the mine plan after a revised reserve estimate covering both lithium and tantalum. The Bald Hill Project area is located 50km south east of Kambalda in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia.BUSINESS REPORT
