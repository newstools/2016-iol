Cape Town - Residents of Saldanha Bay have been left fuming after access roads to the beaches were reportedly closed off and residents living close to the beachfront were issued with passes granting them exclusive access to the beach. The move by the DA-led municipality has angered the ANC, which said the access control was reminiscent of the “dompas” black South Africans were forced to carry under the apartheid regime. “We note that today is a public holiday and the festive season has already started,” the ANC West Coast Region spokesman Sammy Claasen said on Friday. “This act can only lead to embarrassment, confusion and hostility. It is certainly not in the public’s interest to have unnecessary road closures at our beachfronts. “We also noted that these road closures are only occurring in the Saldanha Bay area and not Langebaan. It reminded us of the restrictive law enforcement tactics of apartheid South Africa. This is totally unacceptable and as the ANC we denounce this act.”
