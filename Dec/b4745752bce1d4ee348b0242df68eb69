 Dalton, New Hampshire - Can a near-standard Ford Focus RS match a rally-spec, old-school Subaru on a snow track? Because we all like to watch all-wheel drive cars going sideways in the snow, the Team O'Neil Rally School in New Hampshire sought to answer that question and you can see their research in action in the video below. The Focus RS was reasonably close to production spec, although it was fitted with a skid plate, downsized brakes, 15-inch wheels, bilstein shocks and the ABS was removed. The Subaru is described as a period-correct Prodrive unit, featuring an active centre differential, ProFlex suspension and a dogbox transmission.
