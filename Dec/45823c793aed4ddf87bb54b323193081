Pretoria - A financial adviser responding to a complaint that he gave a pensioner bad advice to invest in Sharemax The Villa, a property syndication scheme promoted and marketed by Sharemax Investments, considered the complainant to be greedy .Ernest Lehanie, previously known as Ernest Venter, a representative of Ernest Venter Makelaars, noted in his response that the fact that Willem Christiaan Oosthuysen was old did not give him the right to lie through his teeth .Lehanie was responding to two complaints lodged against him by Oosthuysen with the Ombud for financial advisory and intermediary services (Fais) related to an investment of R200 000 in Sharemax The Villa property syndication scheme in July 2009 and R300 000 in the same scheme a year later.Prior to the investments that were the subject of the complaint, Oosthuysen had made seven investments into various Sharemax property syndications over a five-year period with the assistance of Lehanie.Lehanie claimed Oost&shy;huysen approached Share&shy;max directly to make the 2010 investment and had completed the application form for shares at the offices of Sharemax in the mistaken belief the commission came from his capital.Read also: Ombud orders repayment of investment in bad Sharemax dealHe claimed Oosthuysen consulted him two days after the application form was signed because Oosthuysen required his signature on the documentation. Fais Ombud Noluntu Bam said the basis of the complaint that the advice received from Lehanie to invest in high-risk schemes was incompatible with Oosthuysen s personal circumstances as a pensioner.Bam said Oosthuysen provided a contradictory version of the consultation in question and claimed Lehanie had directed him to a Mr Coetzee for assistance. Oosthuysen further claimed he was never informed of the risk involved in the Sharemax investment nor was he advised the shares were not listed.Bam said it was not disputed that Lehanie had a role in the coming into effect of the agreements and received his commission.But Bam said the case presented to her office was a hodgepodge of contradictory statements and there was a material dispute of fact about whether Oosthuysen was persuaded by Lehanie to continue investing in Sharemax.Read also: Two more advisers must repay Sharemax clientsBam said Oosthuysen s version made no reference to his visit to Sharemax to make the investment in 2010 nor did it include his interactions with Coetzee.Bam said if Lehanie s statements about the 2010 investment were correct, it would mean Lehanie played no role in advising Oosthuysen about this investment, but came to Lehanie after he decided to invest. Parties making use of the (Fais Ombud s) office to resolve disputes are expected to assist the office by providing facts at their disposal, regardless of whether a particular aspect may not be favouring their version. That complainant (Oosthuysen) chose not to deal with respondent s (Lehanie s) allegations means the office cannot be of any further assistance, she said.Bam concluded the question whether Lehanie rendered financial services to Oosthuysen would be best suited to give oral evidence and cross-examination to arrive at the truth. It was more appropriate that the complaint be dealt with by a court, she said.BUSINESS REPORT
