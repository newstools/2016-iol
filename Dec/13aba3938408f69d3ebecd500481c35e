Johannesburg - Roy Peretz stars in the hit series Pawn Stars SA (on History, DStv). Here he chats about his most memorable travel experiences.  First holiday memory? A holiday with my parents on the Queen Elizabeth liner. I was three years old. I think we were travelling from Southampton to Australia.  Favourite place in SA? The Vaal River. I love water skiing and it's a weekly family retreat where I can recharge my batteries. We have a holiday home on the banks.  Best holiday? Touring the east coast of America. I especially loved Florida Keys and Key West, which had a festive atmosphere, good food and beer and colourful people.  What have you learnt from your travels? Planning is a myth.  Ideal travelling companion? Best to travel alone (but you have to love yourself) and it is the only way to meet people.  Beach bum, culture vulture or adrenalin junkie? Beach bum.  Greatest travel luxury? Relaxing on a yacht in Marbella.  Holiday reading? I donâ€™t do much of that, but prefer the Internet.  Where has seduced you? Riley Beach in Krabi, Thailand. It's a most beautiful place because I love sailing and surfing.  Worst travel experience? Mumbai in India. It was dirty and I had to brush my teeth with Coca-Cola.  Best hotel? Efes Izmir in Turkey. They made you feel like you were royalty.  Favourite walk, swim, ride or drive? Swim.  Best meal abroad? A steak tartare in a bed and breakfast in Croatia.  Favourite city? Tel Aviv.  Where to next? Las Vegas here I come! I may even meet my compatriot, Rick Harrison, who is in the original Pawn Stars TV series. * Roy Peretz owns a pawn shop, Cash Inn in Hyde Park, and stars in the hit series Pawn Stars SA (on History, DStv).
