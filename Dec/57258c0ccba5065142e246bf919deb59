To commemorate FCB's 90th anniversary in South Africa, we bring you some of the agency's best adverts and we hope they bring back happy memories. Cute animals are always scene-stealers in movies or advertising but kids steal the limelight from even the cutest puppy. Choosing between which of these two liitle charmers we can't do...you make the call </p> </p> * Don't miss the FCB special commemorative supplement in the Saturday Star, Pretoria News, Weekend Argus and Independent on Saturday.
