Johannesburg Standard Bank has this week filed an explanatory affidavit in the legal dispute between several companies owned by Oakbay and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Gordhan revealed earlier this year in a court affidavit that R6.8 billion in payments made by Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, companies they controlled and other individuals with the same surname had been reported to the authorities as suspicious since 2012.The affidavit, deposed by the bank s general council Ian Sinton and filed in the North Gauteng High Court, is in response to being cited as a respondent in Gordhan s affidavit.Sinton notes that, until June this year, several Gupta companies had accounts with the bank.He writes that, upon the bank s closure of these accounts, it became the victim of a wholesale public campaign in which advertisements were placed in the media.In addition, writes Sinton, the bank was also subjected to pressure from the ANC, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party.Read also: Oakbay refutes Gordhan's applicationSinton alleges that Oakbay was behind this unprecedented campaign.In addition, Sinton says that threats of a judicial enquiry into the bank s closure of Gupta-owned company accounts should be carried out as President Jacob Zuma has gone as far as to tell Parliament this is under consideration.Several banks and companies have cut ties this year with Oakbay, without publicly disclosing their reasons. They included South Africa s top four banks: Standard Bank, Nedbank, Barclays Africa s Absa, FNB and Standard Bank.Standard Bank says there is no legal basis for ministers to intervene in affairs between it and its customers.As a result, it wants Gordhan s request granted as well as costs.Gordhan wants the courts to declare that the executive or any member of cabinet is not legally empowered to intervene in banking relationships between banks and their clients.Oakbay has said the application s detail is fundamentally flawed .BUSINESS REPORT
