Meanwhile, the R&B star recently spoke out about his music career following his decision to leave his long-term record label Def Jam after the release of his visual album 'Endless'. Speaking previously about his future now he has left the company, he said: "Because I'm not in a record deal, I don't have to operate in an album format. I can operate in half-a-song format." And the musician has revealed he felt a weight was lifted from his shoulders when he ditched the musical publishing company. He explained: "With this record ['Blonde'] in particular, I wanted to feel like I won before the record came out, and I did, and so it took a lot pressure off of me about how the record even would perform after the fact. Once the goal is met, everything else is lagniappe. It's not essential for me to have a big debut week, it's not essential for me to have big radio records."
