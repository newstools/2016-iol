Mexico City - The Colombian guerilla group FARC came a step closer Thursday to transforming itself into political party by registering with electoral authorities as a political movement.The group &quot;Voces de Paz&quot; (&quot;Voices of Peace&quot;) has been officially established as a movement, FARC&nbsp;said.Last month's peace deal between FARC and the Colombian government set off a timeline during which 5,800 remaining FARC fighters will disarm and demobilize.The deal aims to open up Colombia's political system to new players, including the political party born of FARC's transformation. Starting in 2018, FARC will be able to participate in congressional elections, with a guarantee of at least five seats in the Senate and Chamber of Representatives for the first two four-year terms.After that period, they will have to achieve a mandate through normal electoral processes.Critics of the deal argue this means that rebels who committed serious crimes will be able to stand in elections.The drawn-out conflict between the Colombian government, leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitaries claimed more than&nbsp;260,000 lives and displaced millions over more than half a century.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos accepted the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize last weekend for &quot;his resolute efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long civil war to an end,&quot; the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.ANA-dpa
