Daytona Beach, Florida - On Saturday night this LaFerrari, the last one ever of the limited production run, was sold at auction for $7 million. That's R97 million in South African terms and a world record in any currency for a new car sold at auction in the 21st century. But then, even by Ferrari standards, this is a very special car. Only 499 LaFerrari mild hybrid supercar coup√©s were to be made, and all of them were sold before production began. But in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck central Italy on 24 August 2016 - within a week, in fact - Ferrari announced that a 500th LeFerrari would be built for sale at auction, with the proceeds to go to the National Italian American Foundation's Earthquake Relief Fund, to go toward the reconstruction efforts in the areas affected by the earthquake. More than that, it would be unique even among LaFerraris, with a special white coachline on the signature red paintwork, a small Italian flag on the bonnet and a commemorative plaque as a reminder that this car was a gift from the people at Ferrari to their fellow Italians. Auction house RM Sotheby made the last LaFerrari the star of its prestigious classic car auction at the Ferrari Finali Mondiali Weekend at the Daytona International Speedway and the scene was set for Saturday's record-setting auction.
