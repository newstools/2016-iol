Along with his offending comments, he also posted a picture of a packed Durban beachfront over the weekend. Sanco National Spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu said: "We wish to condemn in the strongest terms possible the alleged provocative insults which seek to rekindle racial hatred and polarise ... our society". Sasonof wrote: “Eh eh Wena ... must have smelt like the inside of Zuma’s a**hole”. In response to comments condemning his offending remarks, Sasonhof posted: “So f**k you and your bf. Go suck on Zuma’s dirty, tyrant a**hole if you love it so much”. Sasonof also lashed out at one Mohammed Jameel Abdulla saying: "... you’re a f***in little idiot! Every person you tagged there is a friend of mine from school! I dated a black girl you f***in idiot fuck! Stupid Monkey bastard you!” Sanco warned that unless the resurgence of racism is dealt harshly and perpetrators faced the wrath of the law, it will sow seeds of conflicts that have the potential to undermine reconciliation, unity, nation-building and social cohesion. “Vitriolic and barbaric comments of this nature have no place in the united, non-racial, non-sexist, equal, prosperous and democratic society we are striving to build," said Mahlangu. Mahlangu said these comments reflect private conversations that are still taking place among those who are missing apartheid white privilege, domination and exclusive beaches for whites.
