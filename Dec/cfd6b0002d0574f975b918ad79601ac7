Pretoria - The proposed acquisition by listed open-pit mining group and industrial minerals and construction materials supplier Afrimat of a 60 percent shareholding in Diro Manganese and Diro Iron Ore has been approved unconditionally by the Competition Commission.Diro Iron Ore and Diro Manganese are holders of mining rights which permit the mining of manganese ore as well as iron ore in a mining area that is situated in the magisterial district of Kuruman in the Northern Cape.Diro Resources halted its operations because it was in financial distress with accumulated debt of about R483 million and was placed into formal business rescue in June.The commission found the proposed transaction was unlikely to substantially prevent or lessen competition in any market in South Africa and that it was also unlikely to raise any other public interest concerns.Read also: Iron ore helps Afrimat broaden its horizonThe proposed acquisition for R27 million was announced by Afrimat in October.Andries van Heerden, Afrimat s chief executive, had said previously that the proposed transaction would supplement Afrimat s diversification by enabling the group to enter into the iron ore market, expose the group to a commodity that was traded in a hard currency and support the company's growth strategy.Van Heerden said the acquisition was also an exciting new challenge for the group, given its proven track record of turning struggling businesses around.
