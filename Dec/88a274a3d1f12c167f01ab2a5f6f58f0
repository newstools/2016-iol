The incident also appeared to have a profound effect on the restaurant’s owner, to the point where the restaurant is shutting down for a day to conduct a mediation session with the parties involved and all the venue’s staff. Clarke’s Bar and Dining said it was trying to “diffuse the situation, stop it from escalating further and ensure the safety of everyone present”, after a white woman allegedly racially abused a group of coloured patrons. The group of  friends allege that they were thrown out by bouncers, while the white woman was allowed to finish her drink. Nicholas Vries wrote on Facebook they were called “common coloured” and  “labelled troublemakers”. Lee Sophia Piedt wrote: “A lady came over to our table. Insulted us by asking/stating she could not believe we are all coloured at this table.” Clarke’s’ Facebook page was bombarded with comments as a result of the incident. Lyndall Maunder, the restaurant owner, posted an impassioned note of apology and also wrote: “The event on Friday and what has followed has woken me up to how disconnected I am and my perception of the world I live in has been permanently changed.” Cape Argus
