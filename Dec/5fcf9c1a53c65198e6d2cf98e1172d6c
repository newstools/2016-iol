Cape Town Two people died and seven others were injured, some seriously, when two vehicles collided at the intersection of Baden Powell Drive and the R44 in Cape Town on Saturday, Western Cape paramedics said. Netcare 911 paramedics arrived at the scene and found the road littered with accident debris and the twisted frames of the vehicles, Netcare 911 spokesman Chris Botha said. &quot;After triaging the injured, it was established that two people died on [the] scene [and] seven others sustained injuries ranging from serious to minor.&quot; Paramedics stabilised the injured at the scene before they transported them to various hospitals for the care that they required. &quot;Exact detail to the crash and preceding events is still speculative and will form part of the police investigation,&quot; Botha said.
