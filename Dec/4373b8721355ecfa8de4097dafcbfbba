Chennai, India - Karun Nair notched his maiden Test century Monday as India looked poised to take a first innings lead on day four of the fifth Test against England in Chennai. India, who resumed the day on 391 for 4, advanced to 463 for 5 at lunch – 14 behind England's first innings 477. The 25-year-old Nair, who is playing in only his third Test after making his debut earlier in the series, played a patient knock as he moved from his overnight 71 to 122 not out off 217 balls with 11 fours and a six. Nair shared a 63-run fifth-wicket stand with Murali Vijay (29) before debutant Liam Dawson got his first Test scalp with his left-arm spin. All-rounder Dawson, who scored an unbeaten 66 in England's first innings, pinned Vijay in front of his stumps and he was given out lbw for England's only wicket of the morning session. Vijay had a stroke of luck on 21 when the umpire turned down a caught-behind appeal off Stuart Broad. England had used all their reviews and were unable to challenge the decision, but television replays suggested there had been a little nick off the bat. England skipper Alastair Cook rotated his bowlers on the flat pitch at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium in an attempt to apply pressure to the batsmen. The tactics did restrict India to just 72 runs in the session but the tourists could only pick up a single wicket. India have already secured the five-Test series and hold an unassailable 30-0 lead.
