IN A democratic South Africa, the gains made are outweighed by the government and private sector's blatant disregard for the lives of people with disabilities.What makes things worse is that government, in conjunction with Disabled People South Africa (DPSA), because of their close proximity to the ruling party, chose to pigeonhole disability and place it under the Department of Social Development as though we are mere objects of pity welfare recipients.They have since established a cabal in the form of a Presidential Working Group on Disability, among many other structures that deploy for the self-serving, claiming to serve the interests of people with disabilities.It is crystal clear the government does not take people with disabilities seriously nor is it interested in decisively intervening against the quadruple challenges of inequality, poverty, unemployment and discrimination that people with disabilities are subjected to.People with disabilities, who have integrity, must stay away from government-organised events, and should not participate in a state-funded frolic when the fundamentals aimed at restoring our dignity are not in place.Our dignity cannot be bought with a free inaccessible ride to the event venue, T-shirt and cap, a plate of pap and wors.Nothing about us, without us, is for us.Magic NkhwashuIndependent Disability Analyst and Human Rights Activist
