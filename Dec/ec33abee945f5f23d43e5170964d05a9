Pretoria - Three construction companies competing in a closed tender for a pipeline project agreed to pay a loser s fee to the unsuccessful bidders and disguise these fees as payment for plant hire, the Competition Tribunal heard yesterday.The tribunal was hearing an application for the confirmation of a settlement agreement reached between the Competition Commission and Phambili Pipelines, a subsidiary of Basil Read.Nelly Sakata, appearing for the commission, said that five companies had been invited in 2008 by Boynton Investments and Barrick Platinum South Africa to tender for the construction of a pipeline of about 30km between Padda Junction and Tuschenkomst for the Pilanesberg Platinum Mine at Northam. Sakata said that before the closing date for the submission of bids for the project, Patrick Delamere of the Delatoy Group contacted Phambili Pipeline and Cycad Pipelines and requested that the companies enter into a loser s fee arrangement. She said the request was that each of the companies would submit their bids independently, but would inflate their respective bids by a specific amount, so that whoever won the tender would compensate the others for the costs of submitting a bid. Sekata said the tender was awarded to Cycad Pipelines and Delamere contacted Cycad Pipelines and Phambili Pipelines to remind them that a loser s fee needed to be paid.

The same was done by the Delatoy Group.The total amount paid by Cycad to each of the companies was R1.14 million.Cycad Pipelines entered into a settlement agreement with the commission in 2014 to pay a fine of R3.39 million for collusive tendering. Delatoy Group in July agreed to a fine of R4.13 million, also in terms of a settlement agreement. Phambili Pipelines was the first company to report the contraventions of the Competition Act to the commission and was granted conditional leniency for the project. Sekata said in line with the leniency application, the commission was not seeking a penalty against Phambili Pipelines.

This was done to safeguard and preserve the rights of affected third parties to bring civil damages claims against leniency applicants, she said.Norman Manoim, the chairman of the tribunal, confirmed the settlement agreement.Manoim added that in future where the commission had evidence that fictitious invoices were sent to a company, it should perhaps insist the auditors of that company do an audit of any invoices between a rival company to determine what services were being paid for, particularly where the rival company had recently been involved in competing for a tender against that company.BUSINESS REPORT
