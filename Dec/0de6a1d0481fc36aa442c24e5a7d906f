Durban - Any thoughts that the African National Congress Youth League had of controversial South African Broadcasting Corporation Group Executive for corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng becoming a minister were scotched on Friday, less than 24 hours after the organisation endorsed him. The ANC's provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala, speaking at a memorial service to the recently deceased Cuban leader Fidel Castro in the Durban City Hall made it quite clear on Friday evening, that Motsoeneng could not simply jump into the organisation at the whim of the youth league and take up a leadership position. Zikalala pointed out that to become a member of any regional executive committee the party's rules were quite clear that a person had to be a member of the party in good standing for at least five years. To become a member of the provincial executive committee a membership of seven years was required and to be considered part of the party's national executive a person had to be a member of the party for at least 10 years. “The SABC is not part of the structures of the ANC,” said Zikalala. On Thursday, Motsoeneng told 400 ANC Youth League members at an “economic freedom” lecture that he could resolve the country's woes within six months. The youth league's provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo, also speaking at the Thursday lecture said that Motsoeneng was minister material because he had a clear programme to uplift black people. However, whatever wishes the youth league had, were not going to pass muster as Zikalala made clear. “We are going to debate the with the youth league,” said Zikalala.  African News Agency
