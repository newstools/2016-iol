Banyana Banyana captain Janine van Wyk has been signed by US team Houston Dash. The club revealed the news on their website late on Wednesday night South Africa time, and the 29-year-old defender couldn’t hide her delight on Twitter. “I am SUPER excited for my move to @HoustonDash .The support so far has been OVERWHELMING SO READY for the 2017 @NWSL season,” Van Wyk said. Van Wyk is a veteran of two Olympic Games (London 2012 and Rio 2016), and has earned a record 142 caps for Banyana Banyana since making her debut in 2005 as a teenager. Houston Dash play in the National Women’s Soccer League in America, and coach Randy Waldrum expressed his happiness with his new signing. The deal is subject to Van Wyk receiving her visa and an international transfer certificate. “I’m very excited that Janine will join the Dash in 2017. She was recently named as one of the four finalists for the African Footballer of the Year Award – that is the quality she brings to the team,” Waldrum told the club website. “Janine also brings a wealth of international experience to the club. I felt we had to address our central defending positions this off-season and add more experience and leadership, Janine certainly fills that need.” Banyana coach Desiree Ellis and her predecessor Vera Pauw both took to Twitter to congratulate Van Wyk. “@Janinevanwyk5 @HoustonDash . Well deserved Cappy. Super proud!!” Ellis said. Pauw added: “Wowwowwow!!!!! So proud of @Janinevanwyk5 !!! First @Banyana_Banyana player to earn a contract in US! Good luck Janine!” Independent Media
