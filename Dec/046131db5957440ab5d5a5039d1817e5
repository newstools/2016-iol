Mexico City At least 27 people died and 70 were injured in a massive, multi-coloured explosion that levelled a fireworks market outside the Mexican capital on Tuesday, leaving it a charred wasteland.Television images showed a flurry of pyrotechnics exploding into the early afternoon sky as a massive plume of smoke rose above the market. Fireworks detonated in a peal of clattering bursts that lit up the sky in a scene reminiscent of a war zone.The technicolor blast was the third to strike the popular San Pablito marketplace in Tultepec, about 32 km north of Mexico City, in just over a decade.&quot;We were near the bathrooms when there was an explosion at a stall and then a series of blasts came one after the other,&quot; said witness Federico Juarez. &quot;Everyone started running to escape as bricks and pieces of concrete fell everywhere.&quot;Isidro Sanchez, the head of Tultepec emergency services, said in a local television interview that the death toll of 27 was preliminary as rescue workers scoured the site. A lack of sufficient security measures had likely caused the blast, he added.
