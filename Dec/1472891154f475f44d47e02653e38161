Johannesburg Christmas came early for Ekurhuleni senior citizens who spent a special day with the City s Executive Mayor, Cllr Mzwandile Masina and his mayoral committee members at Germiston Banquet hall. On Wednesday Pensioners, who came from various townships in Ekurhuleni, were treated to lunch and music by the Khayalethu Old Age Choir. They were also given Christmas hampers. In a statement on Thursday Ekurhuleni said senior citizens were encouraged to speak out about any problems they may be facing at their homes. Masina said the City had programs to help them. The Executive Mayor added: &quot;We as the City of Ekurhuleni would like to thank you for raising us and your constant guidance has meant a lot. We want you to know we are listening to you&quot;. Jackie Seritsane, an Indigent Manager with the City, warned pensioners not to hand over any money to anyone claiming to represent the municipality. &quot;We have had stories of pensioners being conned by people who claimed they were from the municipality,&quot; said Seritsane. &quot;If you have any money you have to pay to the municipality, visit municipality offices near you.&quot; Pensioner Thembi Motha, from Vosloorus Old Age Home, could not hide her joy. She clearly enjoyed the treats. &quot;I am so happy I don t know what to say but I would like to thank the mayor and everyone responsible for this idea of a Christmas party for us pensioners,&quot; said Motha.
