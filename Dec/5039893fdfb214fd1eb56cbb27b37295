Keshnee was not available for comment. John's neighbours said the family mostly kept to themselves. One of them said he had been watching television when he heard what sounded like fireworks. A few minutes later he heard people screaming. When the neighbour rushed out of his house, a bloodied John had been put into a friend's car and rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
