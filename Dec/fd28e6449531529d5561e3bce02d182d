Cape Town Independent Media has been keeping an eye on young people, following their aspirations, achievements and accolades and for many years, have been giving recognition to many young leaders. This year however, has that little something extra. The Young Independents, Independent Media's digital youth platform, are looking to reward inspiring young leaders with a share of R250 000. Now in its second year, The Young Independents' flagship Mzansi100 Top 100 Inspiring and Aspiring Young Leaders aims to amplify the voices and actions of those who truly deserve to be acknowledged. Tonight sees the launch of the call for nominations for #Mzansi100Top2017 where Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane will be the key speaker, presenting on: Inspiring &amp; Aspiring Leaders. Our country is grappling with a number of difficulties, which include a stagnating economy, a high rate of unemployment, a widening gap between the haves and the have nots, and rising levels of poverty. We look to the youth for solutions. We need young people to break barriers, think out of the box, create jobs, and use their talents for innovative solutions. We already have such a high calibre of young people and we must produce more,&quot; says Mkhwebane. The Young Independents will work hand in hand with the Public Protector to ensure the youth are taken seriously in South Africa. &quot;At Independent Media Group, we understand that the world needs new ideas, products and a fresh approach to emerging challenges. We look to young people to harness their skills and come up with solutions and interventions to take Africa and indeed the whole of humanity forward,&quot; says Mike Ntsasa, Group Executive of Public Sector at Independent Media. &quot;We are earnestly thinking about the future. That is why we have created platforms to identify, nurture, encourage and celebrate young people who use their talents and who take charge of their environment to bring us something new or to improve on what already exists. They are creative, enterprising, and entrepreneurial and they ask why. These are young ordinary people who have gone on to do extra ordinary things. We celebrate them not just because they inspire hope for tomorrow; but to encourage their peers to look for opportunities in all obstacles. To draw from the power within and rise against adversity. To make South Africa and indeed the greater continent a better place for everyone who lives in it.&quot; If you know a young trailbalzer who is changing the world one action at a time, nominate them here.
