Johannesburg The Joburg Zoo has welcomed news that giraffes have been placed on the Red List of vulnerable species.This comes after a study revealed that there were fewer than 100 000 left in the wild.The global numbers have plummeted by 40% in the past 30 years during which giraffes were listed as of least concern .The Red List is compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Joburg Zoo acting head Oscar van Heerden said being declared vulnerable was just one step away from being declared endangered. The truth is that over the past decade there has been an increase in the encroachment of the territory of the giraffes, he said.One giraffe needs 200 hectares of land to feed per year, but because of urbanisation and development, the number of hectares keep reducing. This means that they are more easily hunted by predators and also that they have less food to consume. The number (of giraffes) on the African continent have greatly reduced. In fact, in some countries there are none left. This new declaration means that zoos and national parks have been thrust to the fore and will now have to ensure that they keep their numbers steady and have some giraffes in reserve. We therefore welcome the news, he said.[email&#160;protected] @annacoxThe Star
