Johannesburg - Vedanta Resources Zambian unit must pay the southern African country s majority state-owned mining investment company about $103 million after a London ruling related to a copper-price agreement.ZCCM Investments Holdings obtained a default judgment in the High Court of Justice against Konkola Copper Mines on December 16, it said in an e-mailed statement Monday. The payment is due within 30 days, it said Tuesday. KCM said in an e-mailed statement later in the day it was consulting with ZCCM-IH and other relevant stakeholders to resolve all outstanding issues within 30 days in accordance with the court s ruling. KCM hadn t paid the money owed under the copper-price participation deal because of operational and financial challenges, ZCCM-IH, which has a 20.6 percent shareholding in Konkola, said in its 2015 annual report. The Vedanta unit was in talks with ZCCM-IH and the government to pay the claim, which needed to be settled from available cash flows,&nbsp;KCM CEO Steven Din said November 10. The company was at that point hoping to resolve the matter out of court, after ZCCM-IH filed the case in June, he told investors on a call.Read also: Commodities to recover in 2017?ZCCM-IH said the court directed that it be determined whether KCM made payments to its parent company that breached a 2013 settlement agreement.
