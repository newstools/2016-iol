Durban - Our tour began at the International Convention Centre for a media briefing, before embarking on a short walk to The Workshop, where were collected by  taxis and driven to Bridge City Station. On arrival at the Station, we were informed about the GO! Durban project, while enjoying a delicious breakfast. The station atmosphere was enhanced by station announcements and the trains themselves. After a brief tour of the Bridge City Shopping Centre, we boarded a bus and made our way through KwaMashu, Newlands, KwaDabeka, New Germany and Pinetown where construction on this innovative project has already begun.
