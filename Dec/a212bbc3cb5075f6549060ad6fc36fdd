Zeerust Four people who were injured when a marquee tent was hit by strong wind during a storm in Gopane near Zeerust in North West have been discharged from hospital and three are still hospitalised, the North West government said on Saturday. The storm hit the village while president Jacob Zuma was addressing a Reconciliation Day celebration on Friday attended by more than 8000 people. A heavy storm interrupted the event by blowing over the marquee tent. &quot;The latest reports reveal that seven people were admitted to Zeerust and Victoria hospitals yesterday [Friday] and four of them were discharged this morning [Saturday]. &quot;Three patients are still at the hospital and according to the health authorities the patients are treated for ankle fractures after falling yesterday [Friday],&quot; the provincial government said in a statement. On Friday, it was reported that at least 13 people were injured when gale force winds hit the marquee. North West police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said: The injured persons include two police officials, a local municipality mayor, and a chief. &nbsp;The storm wreaked havoc, uprooting the marquee tent in which the celebration was being held, forcing Zuma to stop his speech as bodyguards moved in to whisk him to safety. Strong wind accompanied by rain blew over the tent at around 1pm, just as Zuma was outlining government s interventions in Marikana following the killing of 44 people during a violent wildcat strike at Lonmin's platinum mining operations at Marikana near Rustenburg in August 2012.
