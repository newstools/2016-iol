Moscow - Russia on Wednesday promised
retaliation against Washington in the event of new economic
sanctions. US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that Russia and
President Vladimir Putin should expect tough sanctions after
cyber attacks during the presidential election, won by Donald
Trump. "To be honest, we are tired of lie about the 'Russian
hackers', which is being poured down in the United States from
the very top," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova
said. She also called reports of possible new sanctions a
"provocation directed by the White House". Reuters
