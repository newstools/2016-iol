Any creditors claims - with multimedia company Aerios wanting R72 million for its services and commercial rights - have been resolved, added Wakefield. I don t want to single out Aerios. But as we speak, we don t owe any creditor whatsoever. All creditors will be looked after, all staff members will be looked after. There is no need to worry, he said. I am not going to divulge the numbers [of the purchase price] because we must respect the fact that I have a constituency to report to, and I respect my General Council. Aerios said on Thursday that it will release a statement after consultation with our legal advisers .CAPE ARGUS
