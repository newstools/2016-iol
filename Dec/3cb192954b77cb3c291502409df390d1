Cape Town The City of Cape Town said on Wednesday that the latest water usage statistics indicated a drop in consumption over the past week, but there was still much work to be done . The average daily consumption during the week of December 19-25 was 835 million litres against a target of 800 million litres. The city said in a statement that this was the lowest average since the implementation of level 3 water restrictions in November. It said that should residents keep their consumption at winter levels, which equates to 800 million litres a day, Cape Town s water supply would last until the next rainy season. Over the week in question, the city added, the combined dam levels had dropped a further 1.6 percent to 48.1 percent. The city renewed its appeal to residents and visitors to be mindful of water use and to abide by restrictions that were in place. Those restrictions include a ban on the use of hosepipes and automatic sprinkler systems for watering or irrigating gardens, sports fields, parks and other similar spaces from municipal supply. Those with special requirements could apply for exemptions. All properties where alternative, non-potable water resources were used such as rainwater harvesting, grey water re-use, treated effluent water, spring water, well-points and boreholes must ensure that the appropriate signage to this effect was clearly visible from a public thoroughfare. Also, all well-points and boreholes must be registered with the city and used efficiently to avoid wastage. No washing or hosing down of hard-surfaced or paved areas with drinking water is allowed (except for health purposes). Users such as abattoirs, food processing facilities, care facilities, animal shelters and other facilities with special needs could apply for exemption. The next one might seem obvious but one can never tell: Ornamental water features should be operated only by recycling the water or using non-potable water. African News Agency
