What is the most appropriate company car if you win the DTM title in your BMW M4 race car? A unique BMW M4 Coupe with a gluttonous package of M Performance Parts of course. A month after taking his second DTM title, works driver Marco Wittmann has taken delivery of his new Java Green company car. The machine sports gloss black grille slats, rear spoiler, carbon rear diffuser and various bespoke interior bits. Wittmann certainly wasn't ungrateful: “My new company car looks great and is a really fantastic drive,” he enthused. And yes, he is paid to say things like that but would your sentiments be any different? “The colour suits me very well, because I love being on the road in a slightly more conspicuous car. BMW M Performance Parts refine the already awesome BMW M4 Coupe and turn it into a valuable and unique one-off,” he concluded. In separate news, BMW also recently announced an M4 DTM Championship Edition in Germany to celebrate Wittmann's victory. The edition includes a beefed up six-cylinder turbopetrol motor featuring the M Division's water injection system and pushing 368kW.
