Soulful house band Tortured Soul are back in South Africa for a performance this Sunday at Meropa Casino in Polokwane.    "Freed from the DJ booth," which is how they describe their musical style, Tortured Soul live performances are the kind of grown-up, deep soulful house sessions you can chill out to ... that's if you can resist the temptation to get up and dance. Tortured Soul will be playing a selection of their most popular tracks, as well as music from their latest album "Hot For Your Love".
