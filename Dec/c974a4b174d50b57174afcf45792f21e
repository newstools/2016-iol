Sydney - Japanese and Hong Kong equities led Asian declines, following a slide in US stocks, while oil prices firmed after falling Wednesday for the first time in a week. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index slid after the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened and failed to reach the much-heralded 20 000 mark amid thinner volumes in the lead up to year-end, although Australian and South Korean equities rose. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index remained lower after a 0.1 percent drop Wednesday, with the New Zealand dollar stronger following data that indicated faster-than-expected economic growth and the Swedish krona extended gains. Crude oil held above $52.50 a barrel after a report showing US stockpiles increased drove it down Wednesday. With volumes thinning and swings in global equities muted, momentum has stalled after the prospect of increased US government spending helped spur stocks to repeated highs over recent weeks. The Treasuries market has steadied following a selloff that took the 10-year yield to the highest since 2014, with the rate holding in a 7 basis point range this week. Moderate losses on Wall Street, underpinned by the fall in oil prices, are providing little inspiration for Asian markets today, &nbsp;said Jingyi Pan, a strategist at IG Asia in Singapore. Thin volumes are also providing little momentum for trade into the end of the year. Stocks Japan s Topix and Nikkei indexes slid 0.4 percent at 12:42 p.m. in Tokyo, with both down for a second day. The CSI 300 Index of Chinese shares fell 0.3 percent, while the Hang Seng dropped 0.9 percent. Australia s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 0.3 percent, poised for its fourth-straight gain. New Zealand s S&amp;P/NZX 50 Index was climbing for a fifth day. The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to 2 265.18 Wednesday in New York, while the Dow was off 0.2 percent and closed at 19,941.96. Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed after falling 0.1 percent Wednesday, but is still on course for a gain of more than 3 percent this year. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.1 percent after the country s gross domestic product report, while the Swedish krona added another 0.3 percent after gaining in Wednesday after the Riksbank extended its quantitative easing program into next year.
