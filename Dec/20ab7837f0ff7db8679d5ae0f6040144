Johannesburg Former Umkhonto We Sizwe combatants are seeking an urgent meeting with the ANC's top brass to report back on their final resolutions which highlight the grim crisis they say is facing the ruling party.A 10-member panel briefed the media on Monday morning at Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia following a council meeting held in Joburg at the weekend.The MK council meeting coincided with the 55th anniversary of the ANC s military wing.The meeting was attended by 2 000 delegates, including former MK senior combatants and commissars, ministers and deputy ministers as well as national executive committee members.Detailing the rationale behind forming such a structure outside the ruling party, MK veteran and former communications minister Simphiwe Nyanda said they were deeply concerned about the organisation.&quot;We are worried about the state of the ANC. We are worried about the MKMVA and the ANC Veterans' League. The fact that the ANC is going through a period of crisis and that it has experienced a decline has made it urgent for us to intervene,&quot; he said.Nyanda added the members would for now refrain from discussing these resolutions in public.&quot;We don't want it to be said we are engaging the ANC through the media.&quot;He said President Jacob Zuma has also indicated that he sought to engage with the group after the council meeting, adding there was little doubt that would stop these talks from happening.Deputy Minister of Correctional Services Thabang Makwetla and MK senior member cited the stress affecting the organisation's community.&quot;We are very clear that we are seeking to bring an immediate political intervention (within in the party) in the name of uMkhonto weSizwe,&quot; he said.Members also said it was about self-correction and reflecting on where they have gone wrong.At the council meeting on Saturday, ANC NEC member Joel Netshitenzhe spoke up about the troubles facing the organisation saying it needed to consider vetting its leaders for competency if it is to regain its integrity and also warned that the party faced the grim prospect of losing the elections in 2019 if it doesn't shape up.Political Bureau
