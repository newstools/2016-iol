Cape Town The chairman of Parliament s police portfolio committee Fran&ccedil;ois Buekman must request that the finalised report of the Claassen Inquiry into the fitness to hold office of suspended national police commissioner Riah Phiyega be tabled in Parliament, the Democratic Alliance said on Sunday.According to media reports on Sunday, the inquiry has found that Phiyega is not fit to hold office and should be dismissed.DA spokesman Zakhele Mbhele said it appeared that the final report had been ready since November 13. Section 8(6) of the South African Police Service (SAPS) Act stated that: At the conclusion of the inquiry, the board shall submit its report to (i) the president; (ii) the commissioner concerned; and (iii) the parliamentary committees. While the DA welcomes the finding that Phiyega is unfit for office, as we have long and consistently argued, we maintain that the terms of reference of the inquiry should have been widened to include all of Phiyega s failings during her tenure so that the premise for arriving at this accurate conclusion was a comprehensive one. The DA made submissions last year to President Zuma to this effect, Mbhele said.Phiyega had presided over the persistent and chronic decline of the SAPS and compromised its ability to ensure that ordinary South Africans were safe and secure in their homes, workplaces, and on the streets.Until South Africans were free from fear, they could not reach their full potential and take advantage of the opportunities available to them. It is now time that our police service is led by experienced and competent senior management with integrity who will ensure the safety of all South Africans by capacitating every police station with the personnel, vehicles, facilities, equipment, and training they need to combat crime effectively, Mbhele said.
