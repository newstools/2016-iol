CEO Andrew Darfoor notes: On September 15, I announced we would accelerate the simplification of the group, with a focus on building a pan-African financial services leader. The sale of our stake in the LCP business marks further progress in our aggressive pursuit of the simplification of the group. The disposal for cash provides additional funding for the group to pursue acquisitions in line with its communicated strategy, and executing a focused share repurchase programme on receipt of shareholder approval. The company remains committed to a 1.5 times dividend cover policy.&quot;Read also: Motsepe's ARC to buy stake in Alexander Forbes The five main pillars of the group s strategy are to increase its institutional financial services and asset management competencies; grow its retail financial services capability; expand the business across sub-Saharan Africa; strive for excellence in service, operations and technology; and continually adapt to changing customer needs and expectations through disruptive innovations.
