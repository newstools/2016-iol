The Western Cape High Court has ruled that Hlaudi Motsoeneng s appointment as the SABC s group executive of corporate affairs as irrational and unlawful.Judge Owen Rogers said Motsoeneng should not be entitled to hold any position with the national broadcaster.Rogers said the SABC and its board conducted themselves unlawfully.The court ordered that a new disciplinary committee be elected that will investigate Motsoeneng.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said outside court it is a significant victory for justice and democracy.He said what is critical is that Motsoeneng is not an employee of the SABC.He said the next move should be for Motsoeneng to be in jail.Maimane said the SABC has been in a state of complete disfunction and the court ruling shows that they acted in contradiction to its constitutional obligation.DA s James Selfe said they brought two separate applications which were to set aside the disciplinary inquiry that was held in December last year, which he says was a complete sham .Selfe said the second action was to set aside the appointment of Motsoeneng as the group executive of corporate affairs.He said that was an irrational and unlawful action. Selfe said with the disciplinary committee the court was mostly with them, because it ordered that a new one be set up. [email&#160;protected]
