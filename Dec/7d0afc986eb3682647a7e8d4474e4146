Cape Town - The woman who allegedly planned a hit on her own husband was due to face an inquiry on Wednesday at court after a warrant was issued for her arrest for apparently breaking her bail conditions.Petina Coetzee, 44, was expected to appear at the Wynberg Magistrates Court on Wednesday for a bail inquiry.She is facing a charge of conspiring to commit murder.It is believed the Kenilworth mother, who runs a shop that takes identification photos outside the Home Affairs office in the city, approached an employee to arrange a hit of R200 000 on her husband, Austin Coetzee, 67.Coetzee was granted R30 000 bail with strict conditions which include reporting to the Elsies River Police Station on a daily basis.She had to provide the court with her passport and as well as obtain written permission to leave the Western Cape.Police received a tip-off that she was planning to hire a hitman to have her husband taken out in October.She was nabbed during a sting operation in the parking lot of the Lansdowne train station after handing over an undisclosed amount of money to the hitman .National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila says Coetzee handed herself over to police after she allegedly broke her bail conditions by not reporting to the cop shop. The accused violated her bail conditions. Advocate Christiaan de Jongh applied for her warrant of arrest [last week], says Ntabazalila. There will be a bail inquiry of Petina Coetzee at the Wynberg Magistrates Court. I understand she handed herself over to police. The court now has to hold an inquiry whether she violated her bail conditions. If it is found that she did, her bail will be revoked and she will remain in custody until the matter is finalised.
