Author of Cape Malay Cooking and Other Delights Cookbook Salwaa Smith shares her easy Chicken and Corn Quiche Recipe. Great for when you have leftover uncooked chicken, fish, meat or cold meat. The recipe is versatile and can be made in a large dish or individual servings. Ingredients:  3 extra large eggs 2 deboned chicken breasts, cooked and diced 1 small onion, peeled and chopped 100g grated Cheddar cheese 1 cup sweet corn 500g puff pastry Salt and pepper to taste ½ cup fresh cream A sprinkle of dried herbs  Method:  Preheat your oven to 200°C. Lightly grease a baking tin/Pyrex with butter. In a bowl, mix the eggs, chicken pieces, onion, corn, cheese, cream, salt and pepper with a fork until mixed together well. Roll the pastry to fit your Pyrex. Line your dish with the pastry, cutting off the excess pieces. If making miniquiches, line your muffin tin or foil cases with pastry using a cookie cutter or glass to fit. Spoon the chicken mixture on top of the pastry. Top with extra cheese, optional. Sprinkle the dried herbs on top. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Makes one large quiche or 24 mini quiches.
