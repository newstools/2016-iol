Johannesburg - The August 3 local government elections marked a turning point in South Africa s political terrain. The elections were preceded by brutal political killings in KwaZulu-Natal, rioting and protests against the ANC's chosen mayoral candidate Thoko Didiza in Tshwane.The rivalry among political parties was unprecedented; campaigning was characterised by who could fill which stadium better. The outcome was a shock, if not a wake-up call, for the ruling ANC.Here are some of the major highlights of the 2016 municipal elections:* In April, the ANC announced that President Jacob Zuma would launch the party s manifesto before an expected crowd of 100 000 in the 46 000-seater Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Less than 42 000 people turned up.The DA opted for the Rand Stadium in Joburg and the party attracted less than 20 000 people.The biggest surprise came in July when Julius Malema and his EFF pulled a capacity crowd at the Orlando Stadium ahead of election day.The Gauteng ANC was not to be outdone and attempted to fill the 100 000-capacity FNB Stadium for its provincial manifesto but even this fell short, as at least 65 000 supporters turned up.The ANC clawed back some points in the public relations battle with its 62 000-capacity crowd for the Siyanqoba (victory) rally at Ellis Park Stadium.* Violence flared in Vuwani, Limpopo, where residents sought to use the elections to force the government to reverse their area s inclusion into the newly-established Malamulele municipality in the Vhembe district municipality.* Zuma suffered humiliation at the official release of the election results in Pretoria as a group of four women staged a protest commemorating 10 years since Khwezi (Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo) had accused him of rape.The election outcome proved a rude awakening for the ANC as the party failed for the first time to garner enough votes to govern the metros of Tshwane, Joburg, Ekurhuleni and Nelson Mandela Bay.It presented an ideological dilemma for the EFF as the party had to choose between the ANC and DA to form new governments in the so-called hung municipalities.* On August 17, after days of horse trading to form coalitions, the EFF announced it would vote for the lesser evil of the two when party leader Malema said it would vote for the DA in Joburg, Tshwane, Nelson Mandela Bay and Ekurhuleni as he rejected a formal coalition.* On August 22, after a marathon first Joburg council which also saw the sudden collapse and death of ANC councillor Nonhlanhla Mthembu, controversial DA candidate Herman Mashaba was elected Joburg mayor after he defeated former mayor Parks Tau.The DA also took charge of Nelson Mandela Bay with Athol Trollip elected the new mayor and Solly Msimanga becoming Tshwane s new first citizen, while the ANC retained Ekurhuleni after negotiating a coalition with smaller parties which saw Mzwandile Masina elected the new mayor.The Sunday Independent
