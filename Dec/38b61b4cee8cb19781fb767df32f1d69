London A drunken criminal who punched a female junior doctor in the face as she tried to help him in hospital has walked free from court.Andrejus Sumilinas, 34, was &quot;blind drunk&quot; when he lashed out at Dr Bevin McCartan as she leant to check his heartbeat with a stethoscope.The convicted criminal, who has a record for common assault and affray while drunk, struck the 38-year-old doctor in the mouth after he was brought into St Mary s Hospital in Paddington, London, by ambulance after he had fallen over and banged his head.There was fury yesterday as the Lithuanian alcoholic, who admitted he was prone to violence when drunk, escaped with a 12-month community order after pleading guilty to assault by beating at Westminster Magistrate s Court.Katie Bryan, prosecuting, said the defendant was brought to the hospital on October 4 after he was involved in a disturbance . She said: &quot;Initially it was reported the defendant had fallen over and banged his head.&quot;An ambulance arrived and took him to St Mary s Hospital. He was examined by Dr McCartan. She assisted him in his chair so she could examine him with her stethoscope. He punched her using his right fist, hitting her in the chin and lower lip area.&quot;He then removed his head restraint and refused to lie down. Officers intervened and then restrained him.&quot;The doctor, who specialises in sport and exercise medicine, was not present in court to see her assailant sentenced. Sumilinas, who is homeless, represented himself for the hearing, appearing in the dock wearing a leather jacket and a dark blue Christmas jumper with a reindeer pattern. District Judge Nina Tempia told him: &quot;This is a serious offence and you appreciated that when you said sorry.&quot;You punched a doctor in the face and she was trying to look after you.&quot;That s something that she shouldn t have to endure when she s just doing her job in a caring way. We have a vulnerable woman who was trying to listen to your chest. You were blind drunk and you effectively admitted to that.&quot;In 2012 you were convicted of common assault whilst drunk.&quot;You have admitted in interviews that you become violent when you drink so you must stick to your alcohol treatment order.&quot;&nbsp;Instead of jail, Sumilinas was ordered to carry out a 12-month community order which included a six-month alcohol treatment programme and 100 hours of unpaid community work.He was also ordered to pay &pound;85 costs, a &pound;85 surcharge and &pound;50 compensation to the victim.The case comes days after a Unison inquiry revealed that the number of assaults on health workers has leapt by a fifth over the past five years with over 70,000 attacks in the last year alone.Earlier this month, an all-Party parliamentary group on alcohol harm also concluded that round-the-clock drinking laws brought in by prime minister Tony Blair in 2005 had wreaked havoc on A&amp;E departments, where staff are being forced to hire security guards for nights and weekends, and fix televisions to walls to stop them being thrown.Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Health Committee in the House of Commons, said: This is a shocking case.&quot;No doctors or nurses should have to put up with this type of violence.&quot;We should look at the US model of tackling alcohol-related violence where offenders are forced to pay to be tested twice a day to make sure they are sober and if they fail they are immediately remanded into custody.&quot;Such an assault can have serious long-term consequences for a member of staff.&quot; Daily Mail
