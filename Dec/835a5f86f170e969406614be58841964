Dinslaken, Germany - Audi’s RS7 is not only one of the quickest four-door sedans we’ve ever tested, it’s also an elegant luxury car, if somewhat understated. But that adjective can hardly be applied to this 2013 S7, which has been given a serious dose of ass-kicking attitude by M&D Cardesign. And it has the chops to go with the looks, thanks to M&D-designed intake plumbing, upgraded turbochargers, big-bore headers, HJS high-flow catalytic convertors, RS7 tailpipes and custom ECU software. All of which ups the ante on the four-litre biturbo V8 from the standard 331kW and 550Nm to a humungous 515kW and 950Nm - that’s 103kW and 250Nm up on a standard RS7! Attitude comes courtesy of a PD700R widebody kit from M&D design partner Prior Design, including a new front bumper with larger air intakes and a spoiler lip, wheel arch flares and side skirts, a wider rear bumper with a huge diffuser and a surprisingly discreet rear wing. The pre-facelift body has also been updated with the current model’s tail-lights and an RS7 grille; it’s finished in Audi’s signature glacier white metallic, with gloss black grille, air scoops, badging and mirror housings, overlaid with a foil design inspired by the factory’s Le Mans-winning black, red and grey LMP1 livery, all rolling on 21 inch forged-alloy Rennen R60 X-Concave rims shod with 265/30 Contis. Lastly, M&D installed an RS7 steering wheel and upgraded the infotainment software, while leaving the interior decor untouched; smart move, we thought.
