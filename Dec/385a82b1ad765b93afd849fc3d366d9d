Harare - The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) wants the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to create special withdrawal platforms for pensioners. ZCTU has expressed concern at the hassles being experienced by pensioners as they try to withdraw their pensions and has called on the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to create special platforms for them. Zimbabwe is experiencing a severe cash crunch despite the introducing bond notes that mimic the US dollar which is mostly used in that country. Many Zimbabweans sleep outside banks to have a chance of withdrawing money from their accounts. In a letter to the RBZ Governor John Mangudya, dated December 19, ZCTU Secretary General Japhet Moyo said elderly pensioners were being exposed to the vagaries of the weather and thieves as they were sleeping at banks in an effort to access their money.

If possible, you may request banks to create a special platform for them to withdraw their pensions, he said. He said, although it was standard procedure in banks for senior citizens to be given first priority, it was not the case in the present situation in Zimbabwe. While everyone is aware that we are facing liquidity challenges, the ZCTU would like to appeal to your good office to intervene so that our pensioners are afforded the first priority to withdraw their money from the banks.&quot; Moyo said the coming in of the bond notes had failed to ease the cash crisis in the country, adding queues were still persisting long after the surrogate currency was injected into the economy.
