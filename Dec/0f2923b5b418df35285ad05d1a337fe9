Charleston, South Carolina - A firearms expert says he matched dozens of bullets from the South Carolina church where nine people were slain to a gun recovered from Dylan Roof's car.State Law Enforcement Division Agent James Green testified Monday that he verified that 70 bullets and fragments found at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston were fired by a gun recovered from Dylann Roof's car.Green says he examined 11 other bullets that had been fired, but the results weren't conclusive.Roof is on trial this week on 33 federal charges related to the June 2015 slayings during a Bible study at the church. His attorneys have said he would be willing to plead guilty if prosecutors would drop their pursuit of the death penalty.He faces a second death penalty trial in state court next year.The manager of the store that sold the handgun to Roof, who is accused of killing nine people at a South Carolina church says a typical background check was done on the buyer.Ronnie Thrailkill testified Monday that Roof filled out the paperwork required by federal law when he came into Shooter's Choice in April 2015.Roof had been arrested for drugs two months earlier, but Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon told The Associated Press that a jail clerk entered incorrect information that wasn't ever fixed in a state database.When Roof sought to buy the gun, an FBI examiner spotted the arrest, but called the wrong agency to get his record. Without the necessary documents, the purchase had to go through after three days as is federally required.Victims' families are suing the FBI for negligence in allowing the sale. FBI Director James Comey has said Roof should have never been allowed to buy the gun and promised a full review.A prosecution witness earlier testified that a list of black churches was found in Roof's car when he was arrested last year.Former State Law Enforcement Division agent Brittany Burke testified Monday the names of a handful of other churches and their addresses were found on a handwritten list in a backpack.Burke is one of the agents who processed evidence found in Roof's car when he was arrested after the June 2015 shootings at Emanuel AME Church. During her testimony, prosecutors showed other pictures of items retrieved from Roof's car, including a cellphone, laptop, ammunition and an American flag that had been burned.AP
