The premier has not acted against Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu despite 37 psychiatric patients dying after being transferred to unsuitable NGOs, writes Jack Bloom. In 2009, newly inaugurated premier Nomvula Mokonyane pushed MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko to resign after her bungled purchase of a R920 000 Mercedes-Benz.This set a high standard that has not been followed since.It took 50 days for local government MEC Humphrey Mmemezi to resign after being caught abusing his government credit card.But Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu refuses to go despite 37 psychiatric patients dying after being transferred to unsuitable NGOs.Premier David Makhura has removed Sports, Arts, Recreation and Culture MEC Molebatse Bopape after accusations of maladministration. He did not wait for an inquiry, so why has he not acted against the Health MEC where the matter is far more serious because people have died?Makhura has missed the opportunity to show the ANC in Gauteng is genuinely different from the ANC that refuses to hold President Jacob Zuma and others to account.Jack Bloom MPL, DA Member, Gauteng LegislatureThe Star
