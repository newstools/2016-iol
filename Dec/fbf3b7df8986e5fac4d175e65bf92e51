Johannesburg - Thousands of vehicles have been taken off the roads for being unroadworthy, the Road Traffic Management Corporation said on Thursday. "The number of motor vehicles discontinued and impounded since the start of the festive period on 1 December stands at 5349," the RTMC said. "Vehicles were discontinued or suspended for being unroadworthy and they may not be operated on public roads until all the identified defects have been fixed." The act of "discontinuing" a motor vehicle involves the removal and destruction of its licence disc and issuing of a notice directing that the motor vehicle not be operated on a public road, the organisation said. At least 871 of the vehicles were impounded during the Christmas weekend. "Motorists are advised to avoid this inconvenience by ensuring that their vehicles are in a roadworthy state before embarking on a journey at the end of the holidays," the statement added. "Tyres, windscreen wipers, brakes and the steering column must in be in a proper and functioning condition. Windscreens must be free of major cracks and the car should not emit excessive smoke."
