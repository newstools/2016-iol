Johannesburg - The South African Revenue Service (SARS) on Thursday warned taxpayers and corporate organisations to be on the lookout for scams and fraudulent activities during the festive period. In a statement, SARS said it was aware of several scams which included the issuing of fake Third Party Appointment (AA88) notices to companies and unauthorised use of its logo as well as individuals posing as SARS staff. SARS also said most scams required individuals and corporate taxpayers to make payments, also requesting personal and banking details. A scam targeting companies, some companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, has been detected, SARS said. &quot;Banks are receiving Third Party Appointment (AA88) Notices to deduct money from the company s account and pay it into a third party account.

The revenue collector said all legitimate notices required payment to be made through a dedicated SARS payment channel and its bank details can be verified via its contact centre or at a branch. SARS also said it was aware of individuals posing as revenue service staff by using its logos, branded apparel and bogus offices to defraud members of the public. The scam involves notifying people that they have been successfully employed by Sars, and were now required to buy uniforms and identity cards which are SARS-branded and appear authentic, SARS said.&nbsp;AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY
