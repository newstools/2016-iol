Brits Two of the three men accused of killing a North West policeman appeared briefly in the Brits Regional Court on Thursday. The case against Thulani Mtshali, Mduduzi Gumede and Bhekizitha Madondo, accused of killing Constable John Mokotedi, was postponed to January 17 for Madondo to be present in court. He is in custody and was not brought to court while Mtshali and Gumede are out on bail. The State alleges the trio gunned down Constable Mokotedi, 36, at a shopping mall in Bapong south of Brits on November 4 last year. Mokotedi and other police officers were on a routine patrol in the area when they came upon a gang of armed men, who had robbed a clothing shop at the mall. The policemen were not aware of the robbery and the gunmen opened fire on them thinking the policemen were after them. Constable Mokotedi was shot once in the head when he got out of the police van. He died at the scene. The other officer was not injured. Mokotedi was attached to the Mooinooi police station. The three are facing charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances and murder.&nbsp; African News Agency
