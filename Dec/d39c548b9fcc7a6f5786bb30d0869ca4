Cape Town - Radio presenter Kia Johnson says she feels vindicated after allegations she assaulted her fiance’s ex-girfriend was thrown out of court. On 28 November 2015, Bernadiech Draai claimed Kia assaulted her at Shimmy Beach Club where Brenvin Draai, aka DJ Branny, was playing. In a video posted on Facebook, Draai claimed Kia attacked her after she tried to speak to Brenvin to ask him why he wasn’t paying his daughter’s maintenance. Kia rubbished the claims, and according to her lawyers has been vindicated. “On 19 January 2016, Ms Johnson successfully obtained a final protection order against Ms Draai, the incident of 28 November 2015 forming part of the evidence presented in obtaining the order in terms of the Protection from Harassment Act application,” says lawyer Terence Erasmus from Mirah Ranchod & Associates. He adds: “On 26 January 2016, the State refused to prosecute the case against Ms Johnson due to the clear material contradictions in Ms Draai’s version as well as obtaining corroborating evidence in favour of Ms Johnson’s version.” The matter dragged on until 19 October when the Cape Town Regional Court refused to grant an application by Bernadiech to rescind the protection order which Kia was granted. Kia says: “I’ve never been in court so this experience was a first for me. I had so many mixed emotions as I didn’t quite understand the way court works but I learnt as the proceedings progressed. I really had to find a deeper strength within myself that I never knew existed.” The Radio 2000 breakfast host adds: “I absolutely do feel vindicated. I’m simply shocked that the allegations even got this far but everything happens for a reason and I feel blessed for it, knowing the truth has finally reflected that. “One can only grow from a struggle like this. But it’s up to you to choose the positive path...” The Daily Voice contacted Bernadiech who did not respond to requests for comment. Daily Voice
